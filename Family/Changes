Changes from 2.26 to 2.2.7

Fixed marriage dates in Families report which showed the calendar
 escape literally rather than interpreting it.

Changed order of defining tags internally - but no discernible speed
 increase :-(

Changed gif files into png files for icons in Webpages

Now save (and look for on load) not just the name of the current person, but
 their unique reference ID. One step on the way to not requiring everyone
 to have unique names.

Removed conditionals and unused code from previous bug fixes - now tested
 and working.

Removed other redundant and commented out code

Increased hash table size to 8k (should really be user-configurable).

Made maximum number of names in the completions user configurable (via
 the Choices file).

Made a clean (non-error-raising) version of FNIdObj - the old version
 is no longer called anywhere, and callers trap errors if needed.

Made the area to click on to get a person menu into a rectangle of the
 size of the name, not just a small circle in the middle. This is
 FNNear (which was already buggy before 2.2.7, and this was not a fix)

Up to this point, the code was saved as RunImage227StableBranch, which
 is now in the 2.2.7 dir as !RunImage and was also the file from which
 the 2.3.x branch was taken. (The main effect of this is that the
 changes below are not yet in the 2.3.x development branch)

Noted that interactive help was entirely broken as it relates to the
 program before the user-interface changes of 2.25 and 2.26. Decided
 to remove interactive help entirely (since no-one has noticed that it
 has been broken for several years...).

Restored French internationalisation (needs a rigourous checking tool
 writing to check that all messages in each language are in the others.)

Changed version numbers and marked the code as "stable" rather than
 "ALPHA" - necessary for release, but not to be believed without a bit
 more testing !!

Added "Help" menu item to iconbar icon menu, and added a pop-up menu to
 the Notes window with choices "Edit" and "Help". Made the ScreenBook
 page which opens on any of these "Help" clicks an appropriate one to
 the context, rather than just being the contents page.

Brought the ScreenBook documentation more up to date - still need a few
 screenshots.

Corrected a typo in the usage line of the Time2to3 utility program.

Fixed buggy implementation of FNNear, so the fix above actually worked
 as intended for all choices of Show Dates and Show Spouse Dates. A fix
 was also needed in PROCCalcFam, which has 'always' been wrong (ie. back
 to at least 2.18) but the number being stored was not being used,
 except in FNNear.
