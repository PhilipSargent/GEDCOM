New Bugs

A lot of redundant code - most now removed ? See the file "ExcisedCode"
in case you need to retrieve any !

FNMHelp is now way out of step with the actual icons on which we should
be supplying help. And so also, of course, is the messages file.

French messages file removed - needs reinstating when the main messages
file has stabilised.

Want to be able to pop the Marriage GUI up via a menu click on the marriage,
rather than via the INDI menu Marriage=><name>, which is a bit awkward. That
menu should also have a "Child" item on it which will be a cleaner way to add
a child to a parent with multiple marriages - the resulting "Edit Person"
dbox should have the Mother and Father names *not* writable. Indeed, parents'
names shouldn't be writable in this dbox *except* when it is raised for "New
Person". The side effect of marrying the Mother and Father (and perhaps also
creating them as new persons themselves) when such a person is created is a
source of error, though it is also a convenient shortcut. Care !

FIXED:

(these are faults introduced in this revision which have been fixed,
rather than pre-existing bugs)

Some redundant menu items

We are reading 1 BIRT
               2 DATE
               2 TIME

but writing    1 BIRT
               2 DATE
               3 TIME

the latter is correct, and we need to fix our reading code and the GEDCOM
data. We almost certainly need a noddy program to apply this fix to GEDCOMs
to go out with the new code. OK, that Noddy is called "TIME 2 to 3" and
will *only* transform DATE/TIME at the 2/3 level.

A lot of dboxes seem to be popping up with an icon selected which should
not be selectable.

The "Living" opt doesn't work on the new Edit window.

The new interface (with calendar choice) is currently only applied to
individuals in the edit GUI. We want to do the same thing to the Marriage
GUI We do need INDI=>Marry to pop up an event dbox with a calendar choice
too.

New Marry to dbox not fully coded yet

DateWH is still used by the Divorce menu item. This is now completely
redundant, since divorce details can be set using the marriage dbox, as
can engagement details.
