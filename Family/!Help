This is version 2.2.7 of !Family.

!Family now has two release branches, 2.2.x for stable code suitable for a
 production environment, and 2.3.x, development code which may vary from
 working code with some risks from unknown bugs, to completely broken
 code which won't run at all.

2.2.7 is a slightly revised and tidied release of code which has been in
testing as versions 2.25.and 2.26 for some years. It is believed that all
the code that has been exercised over that period is stable and safe, but
it should be noted that one large subsystem was discovered in the preparation
of this release that had been completely broken for several years without
anyone reporting it. For this release, interactive help has been entirely
removed from the program as it is believed that no-one uses it. It is
hoped that the !Family ScrrenBook documentation (see below) will prove
to be more valubale and far more maintainable that the interactive help system.

The main documentation for the program lives inside the !Family application
in the fdoc subdirectory. It is most readily accessible by clicking on the
"help" button in various dboxes within the program, or by choosing "Help"
from within the main menu.
