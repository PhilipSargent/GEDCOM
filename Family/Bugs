Start with an empty tree. Create two people of indeterminate gender
by doing "Goto <name1>" and "Goto <name2>".

Then try to marry them to each other. Bombsville.

OK, so it's an unreasonable abuse of the program, but that's what QA
people do.... and it does show a lack of adequate checking.

It seems to create the FAM OK, and then blow up trying to calculate
what to display.
