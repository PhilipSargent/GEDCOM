If you have a tree loaded, and try to replace it with another one
by dragging a GEDCOM file to the iconbar icon, it looks as if it has
loaded correctly right up until the last moment, and then crashes with
a data abort.

Not reproducible ? If you accidentally make a circular lineage - eg. start
with John Smith, make his father Joe Smith, his father Malcolm Smith and
his father John Smith, !Family copes. But you need to fix this. Do remove
on John Smith, then recreate John Smith (1923) and John Smith (1872) in
the appropriate places. This can lead to a data abort. It appears that
we are keeping a pointer to something we have released to the heap. When
that bit of heap is re-used (which is unpredictable), and then we try to
use the pointer to what we freed, there is likely to be an invalid onward
pointer. I've only had this happen in my 3000-person tree, which makes it
a bit difficult to debug - adding instrumentation generates huge output
streams...

======== FIXED ==========

If you load the test file ...McCotter-index/ged and look at the statistics
box, it says "dex/ged" in the number of individuals box. Hmmm... looks like
a buffer overflow from some long file(leaf?)name like
home/twcny/rr/com-johnswilkinson-McCotter-index/ged
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901

OK, it looks likely that this happens in PROCSetFile when we do

$StatTitle%=FNMT("StT")+" "+FNLeaf(TreeFile$)

because there will be a static space allocation in the Statistics
window title for the filename. OK, that static space was 64 bytes,
and I've increased it to 128. NO CHANGE TO THE CODE was needed.

Note that we also do

$FNIcTxt(SaveWH%,SaIcFile%)=F$

but this is putting the whole filename in, and as we always expect long
path name, this is probably going to be OK.

Similarly, in PROCModified we say

T$="!Family"+FNMT("dv")+" "+TreeFile$:IF Modified% T$+=" *"
!b%=MainWH%:SYS "Wimp_GetWindowInfo",,b% :REM blk@4
$b%!76=T$

So we have to hope that there is enough space in the main window
title bar.
