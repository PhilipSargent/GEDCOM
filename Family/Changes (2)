Changes:

Changes since 2.20:

Completions window limit increased to 150: ideally this should be user
configurable, but since the completions window has to be persistent and
the user's choice communicated to whichever entry field it was invoked
for, we can't DIM the Comp%() array locally to anywhere. A compiled version
ought to be able to get round this by malloc'ing space for the list. In effect
we could do this in the BASIC version by allocating a chunk on the heap, but
then we couldn't use the handy array mechanism. Although I suppose we could
use a Comp% block in which Comp%!(n%<<2) act as pointers ...

The various event dboxes (Birth, Christening, Baptism, Death, Cremation and
Burial) are now accessible from the Edit dbox by clicking on a "Details"
button while the caret is in the relevant date field. This saves going
through a menu selection several times to set details for one person. Making
this work was a lot harder than I expected !! Marriages and divorces are
a bit harder, but the interface is being redesigned slowly, to make it work
more through dialogues than menus. [Note to the compiled version: the Linux
version using FLTK has these life events in tabbed panels on the Edit dbox,
which is a lot neater - is there a mechanism to build Wimp dboxes this way ?]

New (1999-11-16) window for cremation details, date, time, place, site -
CREM tag defined in GEDCOM 5.4 (A slight blow is that since 5.3, GEDCOM
has lost the "SITE" and "CEME" tags, in favour of a rather less transparent
internal structure for the "PLAC" tag...

Since 1999-11-16, the French messages file has been fully translated,
including help strings. This should at least be understandable by a
french-speaker, even if not very fluent/elegant :-)

--------- ADDED FUNCTIONALITY at 2.20 ---------

Edit window allows you to specify dates for christening, baptism, and burial,
as well as Title/rank and a "Living" flag.

Titles stored separately from names (TITL tag) but optionally shown as part
of name on display, in reports and in completions window.

The Marry menu item now leads to a dbox with space for date/place/site as
well as name of spouse. Latter name is required to create a marriage (nothing
happens if you don't include a name). You can set the other details later via:

New window for setting marriage details, date, time, place and site.
New window for setting christening details, date, time, place and site.
New window for setting baptism details, date, time, place and site.
New window for setting death details, date, time, place, site and cause.
New window for setting burial details, date, time, place, cemetery and plot.

"Unmarry" replaces previous "Divorce". New option "Divorce" sets a date for
a divorce.

In the same way that F1 tries to complete a name by adding characters to the
right hand end, F2 now tries to add characters to the left (thus giving you
a choice of people in the completions window if you type just a surname).

The completions window shows birth and death years for all the individuals
(just the years) to aid identification. Individual's names (but not titles)
are also shown in red, blue or green according to gender.

Options to Show:

* Spouse's dates on main display (but not if Show Dates disabled)
* Wedding dates on main display (but not if Show Dates disabled)

As well as the existing Report (in text), you can also generate:

* An ancestor tree from the current person (in text, showing title, name, dates)
* A family group report (showing each family group, giving title, name, dates
  of each person, and date/place of marriage)
* A Website edifice, comprising an index to all the individuals, and one page
  for each of them. Note that most trees will need to be saved to an image
  filing system or some other FS which supports more than 77 files per dir !
- in these reports Titles are shown optionally (main menu choices), but dates
  are always included.

Date format in GEDCOM is GEDCOM format, but date format used by displays and
reports depends on a library supplied by user (choice of library fixed by
option "DateLib" in Choices file - can't change this from within the
program). Two Libraries come as standard:

* DefDateLib (display format same as GEDCOM)
* ISODateLib (dates in ISO-8601 format).

Date format used in header lines of reports has its format fixed by an
OS_ConvertDateAndTime template in the Choices file under "ReportDate:".
This can have values of "GED", "ISO" or any arbitrary string which will
be passed to OS_ConvertDateAndTime as a format string. These choices
can be set in a "miscellaneous options" dbox.

Cross-reference IDs are preserved from load through modify to save. Makes it
much easier if you are also editing the GEDCOM file directly. Newly generated
Family Xref ids are Fnnn, and Individuals Innn. There is a small utility
program (<Family$Dir>.Utils.XmogTree) to convert from the existing "random
number" xrefs to this new style. Currently this means that merging two GEDCOM
files is a problem if IDs clash, though this can be avoided by using XmogTree
with the -I and -F parameters to produce a file to merge which has
non-clashing ids.

There is a "Statistics" window which shows the number of individuals and
families, and the maximum IDs used in INDI and FAM objects starting with
an I or an F, which you need to know if you are XmogTree-ing a file to be
merged.

For cross-references to those structures that !Family does not deal with (ie.
other than INDI or FAM objects) the objects can be missing from the file and
not be fatal (ie. the null pointers that result will never be followed).
Thus, optionally, they may cause errors which abort loading, be reported as
warnings, or be ignored completely according to selection in the
"miscellaneous options" dbox. Xrefs of the form "Fnnn", "Innn" (which should
definitely be to objects that !Family deals with), and pure numerics (which
we can't readily decide) are still faulted and will abort loading.

The consequence of this apparently bizarre and dangerous arrangement is that
you can manage objects which !Family doesn't deal with (such as SOURce
records) in a separate file which you don't load into the program.
Cross-references from the file which is loaded will not cause any crashes. I
needed this because I am adding SOUR references (by hand-editing the GEDCOM),
but the sources are currently listed in a separate GEDCOM file which I am
editing entirely by hand. For any new object type which !Family can deal with
(after future functionality enhancements) simply use Xref codes starting with
a new letter, and add this to the list of types for which strict
cross-reference-resolution is enforced. It would be easy to add these sorts
of objects to the XmogTree utility too.

Internationalisation: now finds the country which is set on your machine and
looks for an appropriate message file. (If you are running RISC OS 3, it
first checks the Territory, but if this is the default (1) then it looks to
see if a country is set too). I believe all strings which the user should
ever see, including all those in the templates, now get translated. There are
new help strings for all the new icons and windows. Currently only Messages.1
(UK) is fully correct, though there is also a French (Messages.6) version
with all the messages, menus and template data translated (which I did mainly
for testing purposes).

Note that a consequence of this is that you can't upgrade !Family from 2.18
by dragging the new version over the old version - you need to delete the
existing Messages file so that it can be replaced by the new Messages
directory.

--------- Bug fixes from 2.18 ---------

* if you have a date (eg. birth or death) and you make it an empty field in the
  edit window (or any of the new windows), program no longer locks up.

* FNScan would not free a FAM which had less than two persons if it also had a
  MARR or similar object - now fixed to free if <2 of {HUSB,WIFE,CHIL}

* Now allow fractional point sizes - useful if you are trying to get a huge tree
  onto a high-resolution printer. The difference between (for example) 5 point
  text and 6 point text is considerable, and it can be very useful to use (say)
  5.5 point text :-)

* saving a file checked for filename=scrap, or for filename containing a "."
  This meant you couldn't save to "ram:temp" for example (or indeed, any file
  name using a path variable such as "<Tree$Path>MyFamily" or "Tree:Us").
  Now checks for a filename containing a ":" too.
  Because this allows a user to save a report to "printer:" (which is
  perfectly reasonable:-), PROCSetFileType now checks that the file exists
  before trying to set its type.

* If you tried to save a tree to a device such as the printer or serial port
  then it was actually saved to a file called serial= in the current directory
  and then an error generated when this couldn't be renamed as serial:. This
  is now prevented, as long as a bare device name is used. If user uses the
  device# form, then he's still on his own... [If this sounds perverse, just
  remember that software QA people often save to null: when doing testing, as
  a way of exercising code without generating unwanted output :-]

* The numbers used when raising an ERROR have been changed from -1 and 1 to
  avoid the irritating "!Family may have gone wrong ... Describe" dialogue
  which occurs with RISC OS 3.5 and above. Now use ErrFatal% for a program
  problem and ErrChide% for a user-input type of problem. An error raised
  by BASIC (eg. "Syntax error") will still raise the "... Describe" dialogue,
  as long as the Wimp thinks this is one of its hard-coded error values.

* now produces a "To save, drag the icon to a directory display" error box
  if you click OK on a save dbox's OK button with a filename not containing
  a "." or ":", rather than just reopening the save dbox at some offset from
  the mouse position.

* Software program name in HEADer SOURce record is not allowed to contain
  embedded blanks (see GEDCOM 5.3 spec). Now use "!Family_for_RISC_OS"
  (or !Kin ... for Development version)

* Version string in HEADer SOURce VERSion record has max length 15 chars (see
  GEDCOM 5.3 spec). Now use "2.20 1999.03.04" etc.

* some programs (eg. Brother's Keeper) bomb out if there is an XREF on some
  level 0 objects (eg. TRLR). Saved GEDCOM now doesn't have such an Xref
  unless the loaded one did in the first place. Trees saved from a new
  creation don't have XREFs in HEAD, TRLR or 0 NOTE <person>.
