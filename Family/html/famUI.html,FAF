<h1><a name="">!Family Chapter 4.</a> Family event dbox</h1>

<p>Clicking menu over a marriage and choosing Edit from the pop-up menu
[!Family will work this way shortly, but doesn't yet, the screen shot shows
the current UI, click menu on a person and choose a spouse from the marriage
submenu:]:

<!-- <p>Choose "Edit" to get a dialogue which displays date and place of
marriage. -->

<p>You can see, enter, or change the date, time and place of the
marriage (but not the names of the people involved). Clicking on
the engagement tab gives a similar dialogue with a date and time
(the latter perhaps not very meaningful) for the engagement.

<p>For those marriages which ended in a divorce, the final tab lets you
edit the date and time of this. A place is not meaningful in most cases,
unless you consider that this is the court which issued the final decree.
However, that would usually be defined by the supporting documentation.

<p>Clicking "Cancel" closes the dialogue without saving any changes made.
Typically you would do this if you had opened the dialogue just to read
the details. Clicking "OK" saves the current details back into the database.
Clicking "Help" brings up this screenbook page in your current help system.
