<h1><a name="indiUI">!Family Chapter 3.</a> Edit Person dbox</h1>

<p>Clicking menu on a person in the main window brings up a menu:</p>

<p><img alt="Person pop-up menu" width=540 height=250 align=center hspace=10
vspace=10 src="pmenu.png"></p>

<p>Choosing "Edit" or "Child" from this menu <!-- (or "Child" from the
marriage pop-up menu)  -->will open a tabbed dbox in which details of a
person's main life events can be entered.</p>

<p>From the point of view of a genealogist, often doing research in civil
vital records or church records, the main events in a life are birth,
marriage and death. Of these, marriage affects two people and is not an
event of a single life. Birth and death are associated with (and may only
be recorded as) christenings, baptisms, cremations and burials, and these
are the six events currently handled by this dbox. GEDCOM has established
tags for a whole host of other life events, and a generic "event" tag for
anything else occurring to a person's life on a specific date or within a
range of dates. !Family preserves this information in your GEDCOM, but
doesn't currently support displaying or editing it. One goal of the
2.3.x development branch is to change this dbox to support the adding
of arbitrary events, and not to clutter the display with events which
don't apply to the person currently being edited.</p>

<p>The first two text fields are Name and Title, which identify this
person. Title is optional, and is typically an indication of civil or
military rank, usually the final rank achieved during life. (In GEDCOM
5.5, the TITL tag is only supposed to be used for nobility titles. To
read a bit more about the GEDCOM version that !Family currently implements,
see <a href="Gversions.html">GEDCOM versions</a>.)</p>

<p><img alt="Person dialogue: birth tab" width=576 height=456 align=center

<p>A single check box "Living" can be set to show that a person is
believed to be alive on the date the database is being edited. Strictly
speaking the tag used to record this is not a part of the GEDCOM standard,
but seems to be widely used by a number of genealogy packages. If a proper
way of indicating this status is defined in some future version of GEDCOM,
this part of the user-interface may change to reflect this. Again, to
read a bit more about this issue, see <a href="Gversions.html">GEDCOM versions</a>.)</p>

<p>A line of three radio buttons defines the gender of this person as
male, female or unknown.</p>

<p>Two text fields give the names of the parents. Filling in these fields
enables the person to be placed correctly in the structure of the family
tree. If the parents are already in the database, they must be spelt exactly
as they already appear in order to connect the new person correctly. If the
dbox was opened as a result of choosing "Child" in a person or family pop-up
menu, then they should already be filled in correctly. Getting the spelling
wrong here would result in the creation of new people in the database, and
it might possibly be some time before the error became apparent. To avoid
this when the dbox is opened without these names filled in, name completion
or matching is available to enable you to choose from a list of people
already in the database. Type the start of the relevant person's name and hit
"F1", or the end of the name and hit "F2". If only one person matches, that
name will be filled in. If no-one matches, you will hear a beep. If there
are multiple matches, a window will open with a list, showing birth/death
dates to aid identification of the person you want. The name you typed may
also be partially completed as far as can be deduced from the list. Click
on one name in the list to fill in the field, or type some more in the
original writable icon and hit "F1" or "F2" again. Remeber that, at
present, !Family requires every person in the database to have a unique
name. It will be a while before the major rewrite taking place in the
2.3.x development branch overcomes this limitation.</p>

<!-- This mechanism will also, eventually, enable you
to distinguish two people in the database with identical names, which can
currently cause problems. -->

<p>Below these fields are the six tabs for events. Clicking on a tab
brings it to the front, so that the fields may be filled in. In all cases,
these fields include a date and time, a place (down to the level of town
or village) and a site (down to the level of street, building or burial
ground, for example). The division between "place" and "site" is somewhat
arbitrary, and in the most recent version of GEDCOM, seems to have been
abolished entirely in favour of a more structured form of the "place"
specifier. It is intended to change the way in which !Family saves these
fields to fit in with the newer usage, whilst still retaining the ability
to read the old forms. Below the "Date" field is a choice of radio buttons
to choose the calendar in which the date is defined. The default is
"Gregorian", and at present the only other form allowed is "Julian", which
is appropriate for dates in the English-speaking world prior to 1752.
GEDCOM also defines "French R", "Hebrew", "Roman" and "Unknown", and these
will be added to !Family's repertoire at some stage. Currently these present
a problem if the option to present dates in ISO-8601 format has been chosen.</p>

<p>The "Death" and "Burial" tabs each have one additional field. Death can
have a "Cause", typically that recorded on a death certificate for modern
deaths. "Burial" can be specified down to the level of "Plot". Again, in
versions 5.4 and 5.5 of GEDCOM, this detail has been subsumed into the
"Place" tag, but !Family will continue to be able to read the "SITE",
"CEME" and "PLOT" tags as specified in GEDCOM 5.3.</p>

<p>A last field within the tab is labelled "Sources" and currently shows
the cross-reference id used in any SOUR tag for the event. This is the
first stage of adding the ability to handle source citations to !Family.
The structure of source records has been simplified in GEDCOM 5.5, and
it is hoped that some of the more esoteric interpretations of GEDCOM
5.3 whcih I have encountered (and which occasionally crash !Family
when importing GEDCOM files from elsewhere) will soon disappear and
!Family cna be developed to support source records much more fully.</p>

<p><img alt="Person dialogue: death tab" width=576 height=456 align=center
hspace=10 vspace=10 src="deathtab.png"></p>

<p>Finally there are three buttons "Help" (which should bring you to this
help page), "Cancel" and "OK". "Cancel" throws away any changes you have
made and closes the dbox.
If the dbox was opened from "Child" or "Person=>Edit" menu items to create
a new person in the database, then that person is not created. If the dbox
was opened from "[a name]=>Edit", then the person continues to exist unchanged
in the database.</p>

<p>Clicking "OK" saves the changes, creating a new person in the database
if necessary. Note that if you have changed the names of one or both
parents, the person may also be moved about the structure, and potentially,
new database entries may be created for those parents. This feature is
useful when entering a database following research further back into the
past. Editing a person to add parents' names creates those parents, who
in turn may be edited to add their parents, and so on, as far back as your
research goes. On the other hand, <b>don't</b> try to change the name of a
parent this way - if a parent's name is not in the database, then that person
is created. Changing the Father's name for one child of a family in this
dbox, for example, will create a new father, a new marriage and move this
child into a new family, leaving the others with the same parents as before.
Probably not what you intended. Changing someone's name needs to be done in
the Edit Person dbox for <b>that</b> person.</p>
