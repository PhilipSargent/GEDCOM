<p>That's all there is at the moment. Quite a lot of this manual remains
to be written for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Manuals always lag behind the software, because no one can document
what a program does until after it has been written. In fact, this manual is
better than most because it describes some of the functionality which has
yet to be added to the code. However, some functionality which is scheduled
for early change or removal is not documented. Writing the manual has been
and is an ongoing part of the design process.
<li>Some quite large areas of intended functionality have not yet been
designed at all. Currently, the RISC OS !Family program is being developed
in parallel with the Linux XFamily program, and innovations in the user
interface of that program are the inspiration for a lot of changes to
!Family. However, XFamily currently only has very limited editing capacity,
and it is realised that aspects of the user interface will need to change
again before this can be fully provided. The current strategy is to port
a number of major innovations (multiple views on trees, NOTE objects on
FAM objects, multiple edit dboxes open at once, no requirement for unique
names...) to !Family without compromising its editing capability, then
move the user interface changes that were required to achieve that back
to XFamily so that it can achieve a full editing capability. This is
quite an ambitious program, not helped by my not doing any family
history research for several years, and development having somewhat
stalled. I have to thank the editor of Qercus magazine for publishing
a number of articles which have revived my interest in this software,
and, I hope, the users' interest in seeing further developments.
</ol>

<p>The main undocumented part of the program is its report-generation
facilities. There are also a number of outstanding requests regarding
those reports, and I have a number of ideas of ways to make improvements.
That said, I find that I very rarely use any of the report-generating
tools, as I run a paperless existence and find that the GEDCOM itself,
as displayed by !Family and XFamily, is by far the easiest way of
viewing my family history. Anything exported, whether on paper or
as a file from the reporting tools, goes out of date rapidly with
any further research.</p>

<p>It is hoped to continue the process of co-evolving the manual with the
software so that all the functionality in the product is documented, before
or very soon after it is implemented. Don't worry - unlike many programmers,
I do enjoy writing documentation !</p>
