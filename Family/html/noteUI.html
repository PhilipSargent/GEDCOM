<h1><a name="notes">!Family Chapter 5.</a> Editing a Person's notes</h1>

<p>In normal use, a second window is open, showing the notes for the current person in
your tree (it is possible to close this window via its close icon, if your screen is
too cluttered:- to reopen it, click select on any person to make them current (this
includes the person who is already current) and the notes window will reopen).</p>

<p>Clicking menu on this notes window brings up a small menu:</p>

<p><img alt="Notes pop-up menu" width=800 height=320 align=center hspace=10
vspace=10 src="nmenu.png"></p>

<p>Choosing "Edit" from this menu has the same effect as clicking select
in the notes window - a call is made to an external editor to edit these
notes. Editors like !Zap and !StrongEd use the full protocol and are able
to hand the edited notes back to !Family when you have finished, but !Edit
does not do this (at least, not in RISC OS 4 or earlier).</p>

<p>This interface is not entirely intuitive and it is important not to
change the current person whilst editing notes this way, as closing the editor
will send the notes back to !Family, overwriting the notes of whoever is
now the current person. It is hoped to overcome this limitation in a future
release of !Family, as it is useful to have the notes on more than one person
open so that you can copy or move text from one to another.</p>

<p>With !Zap or !StrongEd, when you have finished editing, you can simply
close the editor window via its close icon. This will pop up a dbox warning that
the text has been changed (this is always the case, even when it hasn't). If
you click on "Save and close", the notes will be saved back to the current
person in !Family and the Notes window will be updated. If you click on
"Discard" the notes will not be copied back to !Family.</p>

<p>The second item on the Notes window pop-up menu, is "Help", which should
open this ScreenBook page in your favourite browser.</p>
