<h1><a name="">!Family Chapter 1.</a> Introduction</h1>

<p>!Family is an editor for Genealogy (Family Tree) Databases working
directly with the internationally standardised GEDCOM file format. It
has an intuitive visual interface using which details of families, people
and events can be browsed and edited directly on a graphical view of the
family tree. It has evolved from Dennis Howes' !Family, a BASIC program
for RISC OS computers which is great to use, but getting very slow on old
machines with a big database.

<p>!Family will be rewritten in C++ shortly (a version for Linux using the
FLTK toolkit is already running with limited editing capability). Using a
compiled language will make it much faster than an interpreted one. !Family
is released under the GNU General Public License. See Appendix C for details
on obtaining the latest versions of !Family (or X!Family and FLTK),
compiling, porting and installing.

<h2>Alpha Release Software</h2>

<p>At present, !Family is fairly mature, but is still undergoing development.
At any time you should be able to obtain a well-tested and stable "release"
version, and an up-to-the-minute, but potentially unstable development
version. Shortly, you should expect to see two more versions for RISCOS -
a stable compiled C++ program (faster than the BASIC one, but initially
with rather limited functionality) and the alpha testing version of the
development C++ code. The BASIC versions are not crunched, so effectively
come with source. The C++ versions will have separate source and binary
releases.

<p>Currently (2000-12-19) the alpha development version of the BASIC !Family
is being used to develop the Templates for use with the C++ program, so the
user interface is changing somewhat. Expect the C++ version to appear very
similar to the alpha BASIC version, but run faster and use somewhat less
memory.
