<h1><a name="">!Family Appendix B.</a> GEDCOM files</h1>

<p>The following description is adapted from Dennis Howes' original Help
file for !Family:

<p>GEDCOM (Genealogical Data Communication) is the de facto international
standard for genealogical data, specified by Mormon church. Genealogical
databases for personal computers use the "Lineage-linked form", though
the basic grammar supports other forms. This is the form used as its native
database by !Family.

<p>If you look up
"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" in your 'phone book you may
find a "Family History Centre" listed. There you can search gigabytes of
genealogical data on CDROM, copy bits to a file in GEDCOM format, bring it
home on floppy disc, and load it into X!Family. Some of this information
(in particular, the International Genealogical Index) is also available
online at <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/">www.familysearch.org,</a>
the main LDS website, and can be downloaded in GEDCOM format.

<p>GEDCOM files are actually plain ASCII. It is not necessary to understand
their format but the following explanation is included for the curious.
Each line describes an object and is of the form

<pre>  level [@id@] tag value</pre>

<p>where level is a number. Objects at level n are sub-objects of those at
level n-1. The top-level (0) objects are things like individuals (tag =
"INDI") and families (tag = "FAM"). Individuals have sub-objects with
tags like NAME, BIRT, DEAT, FAMS and FAMC. A FAMS object has a value like
@F12@ which is a cross-reference to a (level 0) FAM object with id = F12.
This is a family in which the individual is a spouse (or parent). A FAMC
object also has a cross-reference to a FAM object for a family in which the
person is a child. FAM objects have HUSB, WIFE and CHIL sub-objects whose
values are cross-references back to individuals. Here is an example. The
comments after the semicolons ";" in the following are not part of the
GEDCOM, and would not be in a real GEDCOM file:

<pre>
0 @I1@ INDI      ; An individual
1 NAME John      ;  called John
1 FAMC @F1@      ;  is a child in family F1
0 @I2@ INDI
1 NAME David     ; David
1 FAMS @F1@      ;  is a parent in F1
0 @I3@ INDI
1 NAME Mary      ; Mary
1 FAMS @F1@      ;  is a parent in F1
0 @F1@ FAM       ; Family F1 includes
1 HUSB @I2@      ;  David, the father
1 WIFE @I3@      ;  Mary, the mother
1 CHIL @I1@      ;  John, a child
</pre>

<p>The GEDCOM standard defines many more tags than are used by !Family.
Objects which are not recognised are not displayed but are preserved when
the file is saved (unlike some genealogy software, which simply throws
away information it doesn't understand). For full details of GEDCOM, write to

<p>A technical description of the grammar of GEDCOM, along with all the
tags defined in the current version (5.5 at the time of writing) can be
found at <a href="http://www.gendex.com/gedcom55/55gctoc.htm">GENDEX</a>.

<p>Although GEDCOM files can be edited with an ordinary text editor, this
requires considerable care not to avoid entries which are inconsistent with
each other, particularly cross-references between families and their members.
If you frequently find yourself editing a GEDCOM manually, please let the
X!Family developer know at family-maint/at/nospam.pennine.demon.co.uk, and
the features you need supported will be considered for inclusion in future
releases.

<p>Some PC programs (eg. Legacy and Win-Family) require GEDCOM lines to end
with carriage return. Following the standard, !Family ends them with line
feed and accepts any combination of CR and LF. Use a text editor or other
tool to change LF to CR if you must use broken software.
 
<p>!Family understands the basic grammar of GEDCOM files, but only supports
a subset of the tags. Anything it doesn't understand is preserved (unlike
some genealogy software which simply discards those bits). If you import a
GEDCOM file conforming to an old version, and modify it with !Family, which
is mainly based on the 5.3 revision (but uses some tags first defined at
5.4), you may end up with a GEDCOM which contains a mix of features from
recent versions, and old features no longer supported by some Genealogy
programs. For example, Personal Ancestral File 4.03 will import GEDCOM 4.0
files and GEDCOM 5.5 files, converting everything to 5.5, but doesn't
understand some tags from the 5.3 version, which it simply moans about at
length, then discards. Keeping your databases in !Family will guarantee not
to throw away any data, no matter what GEDCOM revision your base data
conforms to.
