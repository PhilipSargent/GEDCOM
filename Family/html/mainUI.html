<h1><a name="mainUI">!Family Chapter 2.</a> The Main display window</h1>

<p>When started, !Family opens two windows, showing the currently loaded
tree (if any) and a smaller window with notes associated with the "Current
Person". If no tree was loaded, the main window will be blank and no notes
window will be opened. You can load a saved GEDCOM file by dragging it
into either the main window or onto the iconbar icon.</p>

<p><center><img src="main.png" width=865 height=520 hspace=10 vspace=10></center></p>

<p>The tree displayed is based on the concept of "the current person", and
the current person is recorded whenever a file is saved from the program. The
tree will ideally show the current person, his parents, siblings, and all
descendants. If he exists in the database, the person at the "top" of the
tree will be the current person's father. Failing that, it will be his
mother, and if neither of these exist in the database, it will be the current
person him- or herself. The title bar of the window shows the name of the
GEDCOM file <!-- and the name of the current person -->. In the screen
shot above, Robert /Lane/ (1785) is the current person.</p>

<p>If you left-click on a person, then that person will become the new
current person, and the tree is redisplayed based on that person. So that
as long as the current person has one or both parents in the database,
you can keep on clicking on the top person to go back a generation. This
soon makes the tree too big for the screen, and the window becomes scrollable
to see all the people on display. In the example shown, clicking on the Robert
/Lane/ at the top, would cause the window to display Robert's father, and in
the case of this particualr tree, both of his families, with descendants down
to the present day, which makes for a much bigger display than the one depicted,
several times wider than my screen and requiring scrolling in both horizontal
and vertical directions to see all of it.</p>

<p>The display shows males in blue, females in red, and those whose gender
is unknown in green. With the default options set, under each person will
be a pair of dates representing birth and death. If a birth date is unknown,
it is marked "?", but if a death date is unknown, it is simply left blank.
The person may be still alive !</p>

<p>Husband and wife are shown one above the other, with at least an equals
sign between them. If a marriage date is known (and the option to display
these dates is set) then that date will be shown next to the equals sign.
For multiple marriages by one person, each marriage is marked by either
a date, or, if this is not known, or not being shown, then a sequence number.</p>

<p>If a person's spouse is unknown, but they have descendants, the equals
sign is still shown, but there is a gap where the spouse would be. Below
each married couple, their descendants are shown, linked by lines in the
conventional manner. If the descendants are married, the process is
repeated down to the most recent known issue.</p>

<p>In the top left of the screenshot can be seen the result of middle-clicking
in the window away from any of the people on it. The top item of the menu,
Person, will open a submenu on which every choice is greyed out, except the
first one "Edit ...^E". Choosing this will open a dbox for you to enter details
of a new person to add to the tree. If you are starting afresh with an empty
tree, this is where you will start. See <a href="indiUI.html">Edit Person
Dbox</a> for full details.</p>

<p>The next group of items "GEDCOM..", "Go To", "Save", "Statistics" and "Quit"
are options which apply to the whole tree:

<dl>
<dt>GEDCOM..
<dd>This will open a window in which the raw GEDCOM file can be browsed.
Although the GEDCOM file is a plain text file, editing it directly is not
recommended, as it is easy to break the complex structure. However, it is
sometimes useful to look inside a GEDCOM file, and this enables you to see
the state of the GEDCOM which !Family uses internally, without saving the
file and opening it in an editor.

<dt>Go To
<dd><p><img src="compo.png" width=450 height=440 hspace=10 vspace=10 align="right">
This will open a small dbox as a submenu. Here you can type a name of
a person whom you would like to make current. You need to spell the name exactly
as it appears in the tree, and this is not always easy, so you can type the
start of a name and hit F1, or the end of a name and hit F2. In each case,
if there is just one person in the tree whose name matches, the name will
be filled in completely. If there is no name that matches, you will hear a
beep. If a number of names match, the name will be completed as far as
possible without reducing your choice, then a completions window will pop
open listing all the people in your tree that match. If the person you
want is in this list, click on the name, and the Go To dbox will be
completed with that name, and clicking "OK" will make that person current.
In the screenshot shown, I had typed "Alf", then pressed F1. All the names
that matched "Alf", actually started with "Alfred ", so this is filled in
the dbox, whilst all the Alfreds in my tree show up in the completions dbox,
with birth and death dates to make it a bit easier to pick out the right
one.</p>

<p>This is a good time to mention that up to the 2.2.x series of versions,
!Family absolutely relies on every person in your tree having a unique name,
so in the tree in these screen shots, the three people called Robert Lane
are distinguished by having a date of birth added in brackets after the name.
This is not entirely satisfactory, and the reliance on a unique name is one
source of errors when building a tree. It is intended to eliminate this
requirement as one of the major changes in the 2.3.x development versions.</p>
<br clear="all">

<dt>Save
<dd>This will give you a Save As dbox, in the same way as most RISC OS
programs. The file will be saved with type GEDCOM, but if you plan to
give the file to somone with a non-RISC OS system, it is a good idea to
end the filename with an extension /ged, which indicates to other systems
that this is a GEDCOM file.

<dt>Statistics
<dd>This opens a small dbox giving you details of the number of persons
and families in the tree, along with the highest internal ID numbers used.
The latter is useful if you intend to merge another tree into the current
one, as !Family is unable, at present, to check for the uniqueness of IDs
when a second file is merged by dragging it to the main Window. There is
a small utility program which can be used to change all the ID numbers in
your additinal file to ensure that they will not clash with those in your
loaded one. Failing to do this may result in a tree which seems to work
fine before you save it, but which cannot later be reloaded into !Family.

<dt>Quit
<dd>Does exactly what it says on the tin, offering you the chance to
save the current tree first, if it has been changed since the last time
you saved it.
</dl>

<h2>2.1 "Person" menu</h2>

<p>If you click menu on a person shown on the tree, a small menu will pop up
on which the person's name is the top item. From here you can open a submenu,
with the person's name as the title. The top item, "Edit" opens a tabbed dbox
which enables you to edit the person's event details (Birth, Christening,
Baptism, Death, Cremation, Burial) - see <a href="indiUI.html">Edit Person
Dbox</a> for full details.</p>

<p><center><img src="imenu.png" width=600 height=320 hspace=10 vspace=10></center></p>

<p>The next group of items "Marry", "Unmarry", "Marriage", "Child", "Older" and "Remove"
are for manipulating the structure of the tree.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Marry
<dd>Will prompt for a name of a person to marry. That name may be one already
in the database, in which case the two people will be connected, or it may be
a name not in the database, in which case the individual will be created.
This gives lots of scope for creating new people when you didn't mean to by
misspelling the name slightly, or for marrying to someone with the same name
as the spouse you wanted to create. The same "name matching" feature as
described above for the Go To menu item is used to overcome these potential
problems. You can type the full name of the person you want to marry, and
hit F1. If you hear a beep, you know that the name you have typed is not
the same as anyone already in the tree, which will avoid connecting to
someone entirely incorrect. If, on the ohter hand, you do want someone
already in the tree, typing slightly less than the full name will get
either a completed name, or a completions dbox from which to choose. In
this case, only those persons of the correct gender to take part in the
marriage will be presented!

<dt>UnMarry
<dd>Is used to remove a marriage, when a mistake has been made. The submenu
lists possible spouses of the person in the main menu - select one and click
to remove that marriage. If the marriage had issue, the children will remain
as issue of one spouse, and you will need to use the Edit person dbox on
those children to change the names of Mother and/or Father to place them as
offspring of another pair of parents.

<dt>Marriage
<dd>If the individual clicked on has one or more families with known spouses,
this item will have a submenu listing the spouses. Choosing one of them will
open a dbox which enables you to edit the event details associated with the
family (currently Engagement, Marriage and Divorce) - see
<a href="famUI.html">Family Events Dbox</a> for full details. It is intended
that this menu item will be removed and be replaced by a pop-up menu by
clicking on the actual marriage on the main window. However, the current internal
display structure makes this surprisingly difficult to implement, and it will
need to wait for the major overhaul currently going on in the 2.3.x development
branch of the program.

<dt>Child
<dd>This will pop up an Edit person dbox with the relevant parent filled
in. For example, if you clicked on a male, and chose "Child", the Edit
Person dbox would show a new person, with the "Father" field filled in
with the name of the person you first clicked on. The mother field would
be blank. If you fill this name in with one of the father's spouses in
the database, then the child is added to that marriage. If you leave the
field blank, a new family (with an unknown mother) will be created.

<dt>Older
<dd>Will only be available when a person has older siblings. Clicking this
will make this person older than the sibling immediately to the left.
[Technical note: Siblings are displayed in the order in which they are
defined in the FAM object of the GEDCOM file, which is independent of the
actual dates of birth which may be recorded. Clicking "older" swaps the
order of the CHIL tags, it doesn't change any dates of birth.]

<dt>Remove
<dd>The person clicked on will be removed from the database, along with
all his or her details. All references to the person will also be removed,
which means that it can be quite a lot of work to add a person deleted in
error back into the tree !
</dl>

<!-- <p>The final item on the pop-up menu is "Reports" which opens a submenu
listing possible reports you can generate based on the person you clicked
on. Currently the only item on this submenu is "Ancestors". It is intended
that clicking this will generate a condensed ahnentafel showing all known
direct ancestors of this person, and then prompt for a place to save the
file. Currently, however, the code to do this is not yet implemented. -->

<!-- <h2>2.2 Family menu</h2>

<p>If you right-click on the equals sign, date or sequence number of a
marriage, a small menu will pop up showing the id-number of the FAM
object as title. [Aside: if you don't know the internals of GEDCOM
files, think of this number as just a unique identifier for a particular
family. To know more about the GEDCOM, see
<a href="GEDCOM.html">Appendix B.</a>]</p>

<p>The first two items on this menu, "Edit" and "Notes" fulfill similar
functions to the items of the same name on the Person menu. "Edit" opens a
tabbed dbox which enables you to edit the event details associated with the
family (currently Engagement, Marriage and Divorce) - see <a
href="famUI.html">Family Events Dbox</a> for full details. "Notes" open a
small text-editor window containing free-text notes about the family which
can be edited, or cut-and-pasted to other applications.</p>

<p>The second group of menu items "Earlier", "Unmarry" and "Child" are again
for manipulating the structure of the tree.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Earlier
<dd>Will only be available when a person is shown with more than one family
on the current tree view, and marriage clicked on is not the earliest, as
shown on the view. Clicking this item will swap the order of this family
and the one immediately to its left. [Technical note: Families are displayed
in the order in which they are defined in the INDI object of the GEDCOM file,
which is independant of the actual dates of marriage which may be recorded.
Clicking "earlier" swaps the order of the FAMS tags, it doesn't change any
recorded dates.]
<dt>Unmarry
<dd>This is to remove the FAM object defining a marriage. If there are no
descendants, this is straightforward. If descendants are listed for a
family, the program will currently assume that they should remain
connected to the father, which means that the mother is detached from
the marriage, but the FAM object still exists. Children can be detached
from a parent using the <a href="indiUI.html">Edit Person dbox.</a> It
is recognised that this mechanism is a little cumbersome, but it should
only be needed to correct major mistakes, and thus pretty rarely.
<dt>Child
<dd>This will pop up an Edit person dbox with both parents filled in, so that
the new child whose details you enter will be added to the relevant family. A
new child is always added to the right of existing siblings, as if the
youngest. Normally this is OK, as you would add children in that order when
putting data into the database. If you discover another child later, or
discover that one originally added as the youngest needs to be moved up, you
can use the "Older" item on the person menu as noted in section 2.1 above.

</dl> -->

<h2>2.2 Iconbar menu</h2>

<p>The iconbar menu has some standard entries, such as Info=&gt; and Quit,
which are pretty much familiar and self-explanatory. Most of the other items
are concerned with generating various forms of report:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Print
<dd>This will attempt to print the currently displayed tree via the installed
printer driver. Multiple pages will be used, as needed. The method used tries
to minimise the number of sheets of paper used, but once that has been
determined, it tries to maximise the overlap between pages, to make joining
them up easier. For large and complex trees, you can often get better results
by generating a drawfile first and manipulating this to make it a bit more
compact or better laid out.

<dt>Choices
<dd>This opens a dbox to configure the detailed behaviour of the program.
See <a href="prefUI.html">The Preferences dbox</a>. Actually, in !Family,
most of these choices are set in submenus of the iconbar menu, and only
the choice "misc..." opens a dbox, but this is intended to change to a
somewhat friendlier interface.

<dt>Reset
<dd>Clicking this will discard the tree currently displayed. You will be
warned if the data are unsaved and offered a chance to save the file.

<dt>Report
<dd>Opens a saveas dbox. Dragging the icon somewhere will produce a text file
listing everything known about every individual in the tree. Actually, as of
2.2.7, the facts recorded about a person have been expanded considerably, but
this report-generator has not entirely caught up. It is intended to rectify
this omission within the 2.2.x stable series.

<dt>Ancestors
<dd>Opens a saveas dbox. Dragging the icon somewhere will produce a text file
listing all known ancestors in a direct line back from the current person.
Note that the current person is almost at the <b>top</b> of the tree on the
display, but will be at the <b>bottom</b> of the tree in this file.

<dt>Families
<dd>Opens a saveas dbox. Dragging the icon somewhere will produce a text file
listing all the family groups defined in the tree, with details of family
events, parents and issue.

<dt>Draw
<dd>Opens a saveas dbox. Dragging the icon somewhere will produce a !Draw
file of the current display, using the font and scale settings defined in
the Choices submenu. Drawing a tree is a complicated business, and you may
find that you can get a more compact and neater output by saving to a draw
file and manipulating the drawing yourself, rather than just using "Print"
directly. The developer finds that with really big trees (back twenty or
so generations) this can save a lot of paper ! It can also be useful if
you want to merge two ancestral lines onto one diagram.

<dt>Web pages
<dd>Opens a dbox with a saveas icon. This is intended to generate an html
(browsable) structure to put up on a website so that others can browse
your tree without needing genealogical software. You can drag html files
to the two load targets at the top of the dbox, for adding things like
logos, or navigation to other pages on your site. Ticking the box "omit
details of persons flagged as living" will do just that - all dates and
places relating to people for whom the "Living" option is ticked in the Edit
person dbox will be suppressed. Note that this is implemented through the
"LVG" tag, which though used by several genealogical products, is not part
of the GEDCOM Specification. I'm not sure that !Family's implementation is
the same as other programs', but the net effect is fine in this context.
It is intended to update this to use the RESN (Restriction Notice) tag of
GEDCOM 5.5, and to remove support for the unofficial LVG tag.

<p>If you have RISC OS 4, or fewer than 75 people in your tree, you can
ignore the warning about image filing systems. Otherwise, you need to be
aware that !Family will generate a file for each person in your tree, as
well as an index page, and something like x-files, rafs or !SparkFS will
be needed which supports more than 77 files per directory.

<dt>Save
<dd>This choice simply allows you to drag the GEDCOM icon to save your
whole tree in the standard <a href="GEDCOM.html">GEDCOM file</a> format.

<dt>Help
<dd>Opens your favourite browser with the Contents Page of this ScreenBook.

<dt>Quit
<dd>Terminate the program. If your tree has been changed since loading, you
will be offered the choice of saving it, discarding it, or not quitting after
all.
