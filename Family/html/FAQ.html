<h1><a name="migration">!Family Appendix A.</a> Migration and FAQ list</h1>

<h2>Migration from versions (2.20 - 2.24) to newer version 2.25, 2.26, 2.2.7 and later</h2>

<p>From version 2.20 of !Family, we supported the setting of a time on events like
births, deaths, marriages and burials. Unfortunately, the GEDCOM specification was
sufficiently ambiguous and devoid of actual examples that I placed the TIME tag at
the same level in the GEDCOM grammar as the DATE tag. This was incorrect, and from
version 2.25 onwards, this error was corrected. However, to fix a GEDCOM file from
any of versions 2.20 to 2.24 to be used with versions from 2.25 and later (including
the present stable release 2.2.7), this error needs to be fixed. In almost all cases,
simply using a text editor to change "2 TIME" to "3 TIME" would do the job, but
since GEDCOM makes no guarantees about the order of tags at the same level, it is
quite possible that your GEDCOM has something like:</p>

<p><pre>
1 BIRT
2 DATE 19 Sep 1957
2 PLAC Preston, Lancashire
2 TIME 05:15
</pre></p>

<p>A simple edit here would end up making the TIME tag subordinate to the PLAC
object, which would confuse the hell out of most genealogy software, so there is
a small utility program which will reliably make TIME at the same level as DATE
into a TIME as a subobject of DATE, with the tags in the right order. This is
in the Utils subdirectory of !Family, and is called Time2to3. To enable you to
be quite sure that the new GEDCOM is correct before over-writing your original
tree, Time2to3 always writes its output into RAM:NewTree. From the CLI, with
Time2to3 in your path or current directory, type <b>Time2to3 -i &lt;infile&gt;</b>
where &lt;infile&gt; is the name of your existing GEDCOM. Now open RAM:NewTree
in your favourite text editor and check that it is complete and looks kosher.
Opening that file in !Family 2.2.7 is also a good test. All being well, the
file should be a corrected version of your tree with all data preserved, and
is now suitable to copy back on disc and use with version 2.2.7 and later of
!Family.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>I find I am asked very few questions about !Family, and I hope that a lot
of potential questions will already be answered by this ScreenBook. But this
section is here for when you users out there do choose to ask questions of
me at family-maint/at/pennine.demon.co.uk and I come up with answers that
don't exist anywhere else in the manual.</p>
