<h3>!Family Package for Acorn RISC OS</h3>

<p>Following the publication of some articles in Qercus, and lots
of email between the author of those articles, the editor of Qercus
and myself, I realised that it was unreasonable to continue to describe
version 2.25 as beta, as it had been running stable for seven years !
The exchange also prompted some code tidying (and a new stable release)
and a great deal of new development work.</p>

<p>Following widespread practice, I will now be having both a stable
branch and a development branch of the code. 2.2.x versions derive fairly
straightforwardly from the 2.25 code, and will be intended for production
systems. The current stable version is now 2.2.7. The 2.3.x versions are
for development, and involve some pretty radical code rewrites. Currently
2.3.-1 is utterly broken with lots of untested and partially written
code, lots of redundant old code, and the main code containing a mix of
calls to both old and new routines. A lot of work is needed before a
2.3.0 alpha release is suitable to even try to run.</p>

<p>There is an "old stable" release, 2.24, dated 2000-09-18, which is the
version most users have had for many years. This has a number of enhancements
over the version 2.18 which was the last version from Denis Howes, including
a number of new tags which are handled. Unfortunately, GEDCOM documentation
is not brilliant, and one tag was put at the wrong level in the hierarchy.
This was fixed in 2.25 and later versions, but a small conversion program must
be run to correct the GEDCOM files produced by 2.24 before moving to more
recent versions. GEDCOM has changed again recently, and some tags we
carefully added at 2.24 have now been deprecated, so I will, at some stage
soon, be finding an alternative way to implement the location structures.
This should be transparent to users - hte new code will understanad both
the old (5.3) and newer (5.5) versions of GEDCOM, and will convert on the
fly to the newer standard, which should make transfer of your data to other
genealogy software easier.</p>

<p>The package comes as a <a href="family.zip">zipped application,</a>
currently 115k. Current <b>stable</b> version is 2.24, 2000-09-18. Only minor
new features have been added recently, and only one recent bug fix has
changed any of the code which actually edits your GEDCOM.

<p>Version 2.25 is currently considered <b>beta release</b>.
I've used it for a couple of years without it bombing out, except where
it has been fed a GEDCOM which is broken. However, if you accidentally
connect someone up as an ancestor of themselves, it can get very confused,
and trying to fix it without saving the GEDCOM somewhere safe can result in
it bombing out later.

<p>The current development version 2.26 is labelled "Alpha", and is possibly
not as stable as 2.25, since it is being periodically changed, so should
probably not be relied upon.
 
<p>The GEDCOM produced by 2.25 and 2.26 is not backward compatible
with the slightly erroneous output of versions 2.20-2.24, care should be
taken not to move over until it has become much more stable. However,
snapshots of the code are on the site for those who would like to try the new
user interfaces and features.

<p>New features in 2.2.7 include:

<ul>
<li>Should not run low on memory - the heap is extended dynamically when
needed. This avoids the need to set a Wimpslot appropriate to your tree
size in the !Run file.
<li>New tabbed dboxes for life and family events, eliminating a lot of the
confusing aspects of the &lt;=2.24 interface.
<li>Can now specify Gregorian or Julian calendar on all dates.
<li>Early support for source citation via the SOUR tag on events.
<li>Generated web pages now use .png graphics rather than .gif
<li>A number of bug fixes, including a memory leak and an apparent memory
leak if you believed the "free heap space" figure on the iconbar icon.
<li>A lot of code tidying to remove code no longer used after earlier changes
and fixes.
<li>Some changes towards making it possible to have different individuals
with identical names in your tree.
</ul>

<p>The package comes <a href="family225.zip">as a zip</a>, somewhat larger
than the normal release, as there is a quantity of redundant code and
quite a lot of debugging in there.

<p>Version 2.26 includes

<ul>
<li>Some experimental Heap management libraries
<li>Some code hived off into libraries for dealing with the GEDCOM
and with the Wimp routines. This work is incomplete and isn't run by
default (see !RunImage230 and !Run230 inside the application)
</ul>

<p>This lot should be here as <a href="family226.zip">another zip</a>.

<h3>XFamily <b>Alpha</b> prerelease</h3>

<p>Version 0.14 has been released previously and I beleive a small number of
people have compiled and used it. v 0.15 is the current stable version - this
has some editing ability (it will change things in NOTE structures), but will
not edit the main structure of your GEDCOM. v 0.16 is my current development
version, which has changed little from 0.15 as yet, but current development
work on the RISC OS version is prompting me to make a number of changes to
XFamily too, and this is expected to occur quite rapidly after 2.3.0 of
the RISC OS experimental branch becomes runnable. My principal concern is
to remove the need for every individual to have a unique name, which
should not be difficult internally, but some user interface changes are
needed to make the identification of individuals with identical names
unambiguous in various places where a user might, for example, make
someone the parenet of soeone else who is really their great grandson.
This was distressingly easy to do in !Family and it takes a long time
to untangle the resulting broken GEDCOM.</p>

<p>All these versions have been compiled against several versions of the FLTK
toolkit, and on several different Linux releases, as well as on Solaris 10.
My current testing environments include (K)Ubuntu, Debian and Solaris, on i86,
x86_64 and Sparc architectures. Previously I had no difficulty in compiling
on Mandrake/Mandriva Linux and I may find space to have a Mandriva installation
on one of our i86 machines here once again. I would be pleased to hear from
anyone reporting success (or indeed failure) to build on any system, but
especially on other systems or architectures.</p>

<p>The documentation for XFamily relates to the 0.14 version, but I don't
think that much visible to the user has changed since then - it's just that
a few more parts of the user interface now actually save data into the GEDCOM.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> you can put the binary anywhere you like (I just
run it where the build step leaves it, in /usr/local/src/xfamily/v014/XFamily
- there is no "make install" step as yet), but at the
moment, the GEDCOM file which the program reads is compiled in at<br>
/usr/local/src/xfamily/test/test2.ged for versions after v0.13<br>
which is not terribly helpful. Similarly, the messages files are looked for
at<br>
/usr/local/src/xfamily/v014/messages/&lt;name&gt;<br>
If you ask the program to write out its GEDCOM it will go to<br>
/var/test.ged<br>
Of course, you can use symbolic links to point these at any real file you
like. <b>Warning</b> the software is still at the
alpha stage (and may therefore crash unexpectedly) but now has some of the
functionality to change your GEDCOM file rather than being purely a browser.
You can save changed NOTEs back to the GEDCOM, so please take care if you
symlink the write location to the same place as the read location.</p>

<p>Currently, emphasis is on writing the functionality to deal with GEDCOM
and display multiple views of a family tree. It may be some time (and
certainly not until a full editing capability has been added) until the
file-chooser functionality is written.</p>

<p>The <a href="xfamily-v014-src.zip">source distribution</a> is zipped
(currently 95k). It doesn't have anything like proper version numbers yet,
and comes with no guarantees, other than that it won't corrupt your GEDCOM
yet, as long as you don't put a symlink to make it overwrite its input. (This
guarantee will be removed in future versions :-). As of 0.14, the build
tools for the International messages have been rewritten in Python, instead
of needing you to have an Acorn RISC OS system on your desk. This was only
relevant to anyone who wanted to change code enough to need to add new
messages, or for translators to new languages. You will need the FLTK package,
which has its <a href="http://fltk.easysw.com/">own home page</a> and also comes
bundled with some distributions (eg. SuSE). There is a line in XFamily's
makefile which you may need to modify to tell it where to find FLTK if you
install it somewhere other than the default or have a different version than
the one I have (1.1.4). I think the code will no longer work with FLTK 1.0.x
versions, but 1.1.&lt;anything&gt; should be fine.</p>

<p>You might also need to change paths to some C/C++ header files (at least
one lot seemed to move when I upgraded Mandrake versions). If anyone changes
things to use a ./configure script, I'd be really pleased to receive your
changes :-)</p>

<p>If anyone compiles this under a system other than Linux, or with a
compiler other than gcc, I'd love to hear from you about any changes you had
to make to get it to work, or what problems you have that are stopping it
from compiling. I presonally have no interest in seeing a Windows version,
but if you want to build one and have to make changes, I'll incorporate
them into the distributed sources. If anyone would like to port FLTK to RISC
OS, I'd be overjoyed to hear from you too ! Unfortunately, I think the port
would need an X server, and the only one I know of for RISC OS is a ludicrously
expensive commercial offering (though I have heard that there are a couple of
free ones of unknown quality and availability).</p>

<p>The user manual for xfamily lags slightly behind the actual code, and is
now on the site as an archive <a href="xfamdocs-014.zip">xfamdocs-014.zip</a>.
You can browse individual pages <a href="html014/index.html">on this site</a>,
but these pages may lag slightly further behind and it is recommended that
if you decide to download and build the software, you get the manual as a
zip and unpack it into /usr/local/src/xfamily/html014. From there you can
also browse it from the "Help" menu item within the program.</p>

<!-- there is an html015 docs directory, but it appears to be absolutely
identical to the html014 one, so no new info there... Need to update that
to be html016 and leapfrog to document the current devel version. -->
