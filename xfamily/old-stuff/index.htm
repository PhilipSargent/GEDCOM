<h2>Pennine Software Genealogy corner</h2>

<p>Pennine Software, having developed an interest in genealogy, started using
Denis Howes' excellent !Family package. Everyone's requirements for a
software package vary, so it is inevitable that a package written by someone
else won't implement some features you want. The major feature I liked about
!Family is that it runs on an Acorn platform ! As this is an open source
package, it was predictable that Pennine Software would start to add features
and change the interface slightly.

<p>Following Denis' desire not to develop the package further, several users
took on the task of maintaining the package, and Pennine Software was one -
contributing the majority of the changes made to date. The current state of
the package can be downloaded from this site (see the
<a href="downloads.htm">downloads page</a>). For more details (and a screen
shot) see the <a href="armbasic.htm">!Family page</a>.

<p>!Family is interpreted BASIC, and starts to become very slow for trees
of over a thousand or so people on Acorn hardware without a StrongARM
processor. But as the basic interface is so nice, Pennine Software
decided to do a complete rewrite in C++, with the aim of producing a
package with major improvements, and capable of running on a wide variety
of platforms - even on the execrable Windows platform :-)

<p>The current state of this work is a usable GEDCOM browser which runs
under Linux using the FLTK toolkit (which will also compile for Windows,
but possibly not using a "free" compiler). Although a lot of the "editing"
user interface is present, currently the code does not change any GEDCOM.
Under the provisional name of X!Family, both source and i386 binaries are
available on the <a href="downloads.htm">downloads page</a>. For more details
(and a screen shot) see the <a href="cplusplux.htm">X!Family page.</a>
