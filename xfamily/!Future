> !Future

Develop an algorithm to generate an ancestor view akin to the one
produced for the display on the Doc's 71st birthday. You probably
don't need boxes round each family.

New menu item to give a choice of what to display in the main window:
"descendants", "ancestors", "both". These options need to apply *per
window*, so you could have the same current person in each of two views, one
showing ancestors, and one descendants, for example.

-------

Report scripting: need a macro language to specify the layout of a report
which can be generated along the lines of the current main all-person report,
but with particular formatting. This would be useful in !Family, too.

The ability to select a subset of the total populace from which to generate
a report would be useful.
