You will need a load of stuff

build-essential
libfltk-images1.3  (pulls in other fltk stuff)
libfltk1.3-dev     (pulls in tons of other stuff)

-lpng -ljpeg -lz
apt-get install libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev

That was all needed to make it build fine on Precise Pangolin, but when
run without a filename it just segfaults - we don't seem to be able to find
a way to get a valid pointer to a static string for the default filename.

The workaround is not not use a hard-wired default filename (the final
code should never do this anyway...). However, there are almost certainly
other static strings that we are using that cause null pointers to be
floating round. The first time we try to use one, we will crash ...
Need to learn how modern C++ does default strings likethis.
