You will need a load of stuff

build-essential
libfltk-images1.3  (pulls in other fltk stuff)
libfltk1.3-dev     (pulls in tons of other stuff)

-lpng -ljpeg -lz -lXext
apt-get install libpng-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev libxext-dev

On debian 11 arm64, we needed libjpeg62-turbo-dev rather than libjpeg62-dev 

That was all that we needed to make it build fine from Precise Pangolin to
Jammy on Ubuntu, and on Debian Bullseye.

When run without a filename it just segfaults - we don't seem to be able to find
a way to get a valid pointer to a static string for the default filename.

The workaround is not not use a hard-wired default filename (the final
code should never do this anyway...). However, there are almost certainly
other static strings that we are using that cause null pointers to be
floating round. The first time we try to use one, we will crash ...
Need to learn how modern C++ does default strings like this. Think you
need to do strdup("string") which just seems to waste a bit of extra space :-(

In practice, we really have not solved the issue of running the program without
any tree to display, and the codebase now includes a default tree with just one
person named "unknown", but we still need to store the filename if we want to load
this by default. What would be better would be to create this minimal tree when
called with no tree to load.
