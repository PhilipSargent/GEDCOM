These are cluttering up the v0.21-Bugs file but are believed fixed in v0.20 already

first observed 2020-05-21 in a freshly built XFamily on Eoan:
Loading our main tree, we see
Constructor for I1229, @INDI@
pointer 0 of object INDI on which add_subobject operates
What we are adding is first subobject
Constructor for FAMC, @F9@
pointer 0 of object BIRT on which add_subobject operates
What we are adding is first subobject
pointer 0 of object DATE on which add_subobject operates
What we are adding is first subobject
*** buffer overflow detected ***: ./XFamily terminated
 I think this is probably the first BIRT->DATE->TIME structure we
encounter in the tree. Ah, wait, there's a random string in the file
on the _next_ indi, so the buffer overflow is actually on the "INDI"
tag (which is much longer with the random string...)
Whilst this is a bug in the GEDCOM, we do need some sort of check to
avoid being tripped like this... Believe this is FIXED 2020-05-24

first observed 2020-05-21 in a freshly built XFamily on Eoan:
Debug info suggests that we have loaded the entire file, and processed our way
through all the 0 @@ FAM objects (ending with 0 @F1777@ FAM) and then, with
no further debug output, we segfault. There was a long delay and we didn't
see the segfault message until I hit return. Trying again, I see the segfault
as soon as I hit return - no significant delay. This turns out to be a change
in the way that the C-compiler treats calls to methods of a class. It used to
be that when we were called, we could test for this==NULL and act accordingly.
Now, if we call a method on a NULL pointer, the code segfaults. I fixed this
for calls on indidisplay::findfam where we relied on this test and did indeed
call the method on NULL pointers quite happily under older compilers.
There are a number of warnings that testing this against NULL is broken,
which implies that I am potentially reying on this test to save the code
if methods are called on NULLs. We need to fix all the places where these
methods are called to test for a NULL pointer to avoid calling on it.

These are (at least)

display.cxx: In member function ‘GEDCOM_object* famdisplay::whoisat(int, int, int, indidisplay*&, famdisplay*&) const’:
display.cxx:569:3: warning: nonnull argument ‘this’ compared to NULL [-Wnonnull-compare]
  569 |   if (this == NULL) return NULL;

display.cxx: In member function ‘GEDCOM_object* indidisplay::whoisat(int, int, int, indidisplay*&, famdisplay*&) const’:
display.cxx:417:3: warning: nonnull argument ‘this’ compared to NULL [-Wnonnull-compare]
  417 |   if (this == NULL) return NULL;

believe I fixed those two

objects.cxx: In member function ‘treeinstance* GEDCOM_object::root()’:
objects.cxx:772:3: warning: nonnull argument ‘this’ compared to NULL [-Wnonnull-compare]
  772 |   if (this==NULL) {

I believe I've fixed that one

objects.cxx: In member function ‘GEDCOM_object* GEDCOM_object::parental_family() const’:
objects.cxx:990:4: warning: nonnull argument ‘this’ compared to NULL [-Wnonnull-compare]
  990 |    if (this==NULL) return NULL;

OK, I've defensively coded the calls, although in practice I don't think some would
ever have been called on Null, relying on the test...

Think I got all the ones where we test on this==NULL, but there may be others
in other source files where I don't check for NULL before calling methods. These
may all be in places where we already have confidence from the context that we
have a real pointer - I believe that I would have inserted those tests in all
cases where I thought we would call on a NULL pointer (because it was clearly
simpler and clearer to do the test in the method, just once).

Fixed in v 0.21 (there may be others)

2022-12-14 navigating tree to a person with only one known parent, and opening an
  indiUI, the unknown parent should have the id box replaced by an "Add" button,
  as is the case when creating a new person and adding parents. This bug was
  noticed in the code rather than found in testing, so proved it did cause the
  expected issue, then fixed it.
