Common things we need to do, which might be best made
into complete methods to avoid repetition. We'll list
these as we come across them, rather than exhaustively.
Once you've written a method, you can then go through
an remove the code duplication at leisure.

Check a gender

1) on an INDI:

char* gender;
GEDCOM_object* test = indi->subobject( SEX_tag );
if (test!=NULL) gender=test->value(); else gender=strdup("U");

if (*gender=='M') ...

Find a FAM object from an INDI's FAMC or FAMS:
already written:

  GEDCOM_object *person = <however you find this person>
  GEDCOM_object *famc = person->parental_family();

To find a specific CHIL object matching an INDI id

;  GEDCOM_id* indi_id = person->getid();
  GEDCOM_object *child = NULL:
  GEDCOM_object *chil;
  chil = famc->child(&child);
  while (chil!=NULL) {
    if (person==chil->getxref()) return chil;
    chil = famc->child(&child);
  }

in which "child" maintains our position in the list of CHILs between calls

To find a spouse {HUSB, WIFE} object matching an INDI id without knowing the gender of person

  GEDCOM_object *fams=NULL;
  fams = person->own_family( fams );
  while (fams!=NULL) {
    if (person==fams->thewife()) {
      spouse = person->subobject(WIFE_tag);
    }
    if (person==fams->thehusband()) {
      spouse = person->subobject(HUSB_tag);
    }
    // if spouse is NULL here we have broken GEDCOM (which
    // do whatever it is you need the spouse for ... eg:
    if fams->delete_subobject( spouse ) {
      if fams->garbage_fam() tree->remove_fam( fams );
    }
    // or
    return spouse;

    fams = person->own_family( fams );
  }

To then delete a spouse from a FAM it's a simple object removal,
but then you *may* want to garbage collect the FAM if it no longer
contains any cross-referencing tags {HUSB,WIFE,CHIL}
