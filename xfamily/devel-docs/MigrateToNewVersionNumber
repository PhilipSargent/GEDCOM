Starting a new version of XFamily

written as we transition from v020 to v021 in the hope of adding code to
add parents to an editindi dbox.

Change version numbers and copyright dates in the MessageSrc file
change strcpy(msgfile,"/usr/local/src/xfamily/v021/messages/");
 in xlate.cxx to point to current version. The fact that this is
 hard-coded is a bug, but we do need to deal with it each time
 until we find a way to find the messages file cleanly.
Run ./StringFactory.py

That stuff should go away as we eliminate the esoteric internationalisation code.

Look at fixes.h and convert all the conditional compilation things which
have been well tested and are working to established code without the
conditionals. Back out any that we think don't do the job and are
switched off in fixes.h.

We note that there are quite a lot of switched off fixes in v020, but
at least one is for stuff we believe we do want, but wasn't compiling
cleanly. Should we go back and fix this properly in v020 before moving
to v021 ?

fix0001 is currently active, but the fix doesn't work. Leave in, but
aim to fix the code which it enables.

fltk13  is needed by fix0001 and not used anywhere else

fix0003 has been removed for some time, but comments still refer to accumulating
        experience with fix0003 before doing more. This seems to relate to the
        ongoing fix0001 problems.

fix0005 is active - the tested code it enabled has already been made
permanent, the rest is still to write, so it is actually unused at
the moment.

fix0008 is disabled and no code uses it. This may indicate that the
fix has not yet been implemented rather than made permanent already...

fix0009 ditto

fix0012 definitely awaiting implementation - there's a file of notes
        Eliminate-treeinstance-geteventobject

fix0014 added integrity check - made permanent

fix0016 added ID to completions window, Well tested, made permanenet.

fix0022 inactive - breaks compile ? Need to make this work... but
fix0024 active - we think this solves the issue that 0022 was for
        both removed, fix0024 made permanent

fix0023 active, now made permanent. Eliminate fixed ID buffer

fix0026 active, now permanent - it governed a piece of code that needed to be added
        and was only conditional during development. Now tested and fine.

OK, after cleaning up the fixes we did

make clean
make depend
make

and that made a binary without errors so we can consider the migration to v021
to have worked and been adequately documented. Probably need to test running
on a different distro (this was under focal, so 22.04 will be along soon and
indeed, was good).
