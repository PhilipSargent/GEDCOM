infoUI has no minimise or maximise buttons.
it gets

w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
w->set_non_modal();

indiUI (and famUI) has a minimise, but no maximise button
it gets ... nothing done to top window

findUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);
o->hotspot( find_ok, 0);

completionsUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);

prefUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);

Ah, now notesUI has both a minimise and a maximise button
it gets

window->resizable(input);
window->size(720,80+(this->restore())*15);
input->when(FL_WHEN_CHANGED);

mainUI has a minimise button and SHOULD have a maximise button, but doesn't
it gets

w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
w->resizable(scroll);
w->size_range(400,100,maxX,maxY);

so the differences include that size_range call on mainUI,
and the input->when(FL_WHEN_CHANGED) call on notesUI
What exactly does the doc for ->resizable( <thing> ) say ?

Aaagghh  ! What happened there ??? I just restarted X/KDE and now when I run
./XFamily, I have a maximise button - I haven't changed anything and I haven't
recompiled either XFamily or fltk for ages ....  Wierd !!
And next time I run it, its gone again...
I compiled it against released stable fltk 1.1.7 on Solaris, and I have a maximise
button. Something very odd is going on ...
