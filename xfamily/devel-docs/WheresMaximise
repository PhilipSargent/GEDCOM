infoUI has no minimise or maximise buttons.
it gets

w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
w->set_non_modal();

indiUI (and famUI) has a minimise, but no maximise button
it gets ... nothing done to top window

findUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);
o->hotspot( find_ok, 0);

completionsUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);

prefUI
it gets

o->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);

Ah, now notesUI has both a minimise and a maximise button
it gets

window->resizable(input);
window->size(720,80+(this->restore())*15);
input->when(FL_WHEN_CHANGED);

mainUI has a minimise button and SHOULD have a maximise button, but doesn't
it gets

w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
w->resizable(scroll);
w->size_range(400,100,maxX,maxY);

so the differences include that size_range call on mainUI,
and the input->when(FL_WHEN_CHANGED) call on notesUI
What exactly does the doc for ->resizable( <thing> ) say ?

Aaagghh  ! What happened there ??? I just restarted X/KDE and now when I run
./XFamily, I have a maximise button - I haven't changed anything and I haven't
recompiled either XFamily or fltk for ages ....  Wierd !!
And next time I run it, its gone again...
I compiled it against released stable fltk 1.1.7 on Solaris, and I have a maximise
button. Something very odd is going on ...

On precise, with fltk 1.3, we have (so far) had a maximise button every time.
However, quite often, the main window will change the physical screen (within
the desktop) when resized by an internal event (like a new current person).
The window should *never* resize or move on any internal change. This seems
to be because we effectively close and reopen the window, which lets the window
manager make decisions for us... and I think we cured that some time ago, haven't
been seeing it in utopic with FLTK 1.3.

If you maximise, the window border vanishes and you can't resize by dragging
an edge.

However, an issue that we have is that if you maximise the window with a small
tree, then change current person so that the canvas gets bigger, the window
stays the same size, and still believes it is maximised. It should either:

a) continue to believe that it is maximised, and automagically expand either
as big as the screen or as big as the canvas (whichever is smaller)    or

b) stay the smae size, but cease to believe it is maximised, so that clicking
on maximise again actually maximises it.

Whenever it changes size, it should also scroll so the canvas occupies the whole
area of the window. I've failed to fix tis one for getting on two decades :-(
