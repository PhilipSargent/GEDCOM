We certainly seem to be destroying a lot of GEDCOM_strings, and their
values.

On save we do indeed destroy three GEDCOM_objects and their values
(these will be the three 0 NOTE objects which defined current persons).

We do indeed destroy an indiUI when it is closed, however, we note that
nothing else is being destroyed when we change the notes and save back
to GEDCOM. I had thought that we did do that save back, but it seems
that we don't. That would be a useful fix...
