Up to version v021, xfamily has used a rather "homegrown" method of translating messages
intended to allow the user to change language whilst the program is running. Last time
I tried to do so, it became clear that the system is broke. The aim in v022 is to remove
all of this homegrown message substitution code and simply revert the whole shebang to
UK-English only, with a view to some future developer putting back some more mainstream
internationlisation soution later, if required. There are two main advantages

1) the code is simplified and the intent of each error message or the use of each button
   is clarified for new developers by being abe to see the message in the cod.
2) The whole step of generaston of messgae files and supporting code is removed. It was
   never supported by the Makefile, so relied on the developer to understand what was
   going on in a quite counter-conceptual manner. We should end with a system where "make"
   actually makes everything.

To remove it, I need to understand it.

The text of all messages and captions on gui widgets appears in MessageSrc. A Python (2)
script takes MessagesSrc and generates

languages.h   which #defines a macro to say how many languages there are
languages.cxx which generates the language submenu structure
messages.<xx> where the <xx>s are the various ISO-639 language codes
strings.h     declares all the static strings
strings.cxx   defines all the static strings
xlatestr.cxx  the code which calls the function to copy the messages

When a new language is configured (or at program startup), that code fills in all
the stati message strings with values from a messages file.

When we actually want to emit a string in our chosen anguage, we call things like

in trees.cxx : fl_alert(msg_outopenfail);
in gui.cxx :   { Fl_Window* o = completionswin = new Fl_Window( 400, 500, msg_famcompletions_title );

Essentially, all we are going to do is to substitute for those named strings, the actual text
of the relevant message from the messages/en-gb file, and get rid of all the cruft, which will
include the python script, the two header and three C++ source files.

OK, that seems to have been a success, but we now need to document bugs/features that
may be the result of that work.

Open a notes window on an INDI who has ntes. The title of the Window is

"X!Family MainTreeLink.ged"

whereas I believe there is code to make the title specific to the INDI and apparent
that the NOTE object is on that INDI (as opposed to on an event, for example). Oh, OK,
I hadn't recalled this idom. So there is a line of "Text for" with a string like
"INDI I1989 Leslie /Parker/ (NOTE)" or "CHR I1989 Leslie /Parker/ (NOTE) " which does
the required ID. But clearly we have code which anticiated that we woud be putting that
in the Window title (where it can be seen when choosing a window from the taskbar, for
example). We should look into that...
