OK, we need more documentation - currently we only open a find dbox in response
to a menu->GoTo, but we have buttons to do similar searches from an indiUI and
(we should have) from a famUI (for Person->Marry menu item).

But searchfind is currently only a callback on the initial window
which is popped up in response to the GoTo menu item...

We don't want to set up almost-duplicate code for every dbox which
has the search buttons, so we need a better callback structure here.

First: where might we be setting up these buttons ?

1) Menu->GoTo on a mainUI
2) on Mother's name in an indiUI
3) on Father's name in an indiUI
4) on spouses's name in a famUI

currently, we don't do that for case (4), as we don't open any dbox
in response to a Person->Marry menu click.

In !Family, in response to that menu click, we pop up a simplified
dbox, but we have, in many ways, found this to be a pain. However
there is a logic to it, in that the main famUI alwyas has Husband
first and Wife second, whereas the "Marry" dbox has the person for
which it was opened first, and the intended spouse second, with
the gender implied.

One approach here is to reuse the same famUI, but have it set up
with a flag to determine whether Husband or Wife appears first.
This should avoid some code duplication and some ease of use
issues, but may make the interface more confusing in other
circumstances. This is a design issue we need to think about
before wading in to code...
