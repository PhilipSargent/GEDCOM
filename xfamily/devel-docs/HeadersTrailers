As we are loading tree (from !Family), we get headlist to hold:

0 HEAD
1 SOUR !Family_for_RISC_OS
2 VERS 2.2.7 20071018
1 GEDC
2 VERS 5.3
2 FORM LINEAGE-LINKED
2 LANG English
1 LANG English
1 SUBM @A1@
1 SCHEMA
2 INDI
3 _NINO
4 LABL NATIONAL_INSURANCE_NUMBER
4 DEFN United Kingdom National Insurance Number
4 ISA IDNO
1 SCHEMA
2 INDI
3 _NHSNO
4 LABL NATIONAL_HEALTH_NUMBER
4 DEFN United Kingdom National Health Service Number
4 ISA IDNO

and the 1 SOUR object needs hacked to be:

1 SOUR xfamily for Linux
2 VERS 0.17 2013-01-14

which we should probably do at the time we load the GEDCOM

the rest is probably OK - but beware that 1 SUBM @A1@
points at something later on, in the trlrlist. Actually, the
rest should be fixed - everything in the header is a statement
of things we support and may use in the tree. BUT, of course,
anything we read and don't understand in the main tree, we will
simply preserve, so anything in the header that tells other
software what it might find in this tree (like 1 GEDC 2 VERS 5.3,
and all the 1 SCHEMA objects) must be preserved.

The trlrlist contains any objects where the level zero object
is none of HEAD INDI FAM SOUR or REPO, which in our tree, means
SUBM, NOTE and TRLR itself.

there should be a method to create a SUBM object if we don't have
one already, and that will need that we add a 1 SUBM @ref@ object
in the headlist to point to it.

On output we need to throw away all the NOTE Person and NOTE View
objects, and create new ones based on the current view(s), which,
as of fix0005 in v017, we do.


Our best approach is going to be in treeinstance::save(), where
we have access to the list heads

current trailer stuff is:
