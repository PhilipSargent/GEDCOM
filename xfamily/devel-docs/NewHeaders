Because we have't had read/write editing capabilty, we have
maintained the GEDCOM under RISCOS !Family all these years,
and the file headers reflect this. Now we can do the work in
X!Family, we can updtae these (and the program should save
files with the new headers, rather than me just changing the
file...)

An obvious issue is that we use a mix of VERS 5.3 and VERS 5.5
Do we believe there is any reason not to mention both ?

I have never specified a language. Even the 5.5 spec. doesn't
actually say how to specify UTF-8... 5.5.1 does

1 CHAR UTF-8

The 1 SCHEMA construct was taken out of 5.5, which is a pity,
as we have no other formal way of keeping these national ID
numbers. Although, having said that, 5.5.1 includes the IDNO
tag for "National ID number" which can have a subordinate
structure the most useful of which would be +1 TYPE, eg.
for dad:

1 IDNO TH 91 11 70 D
2 TYPE UK National Insurance Number
1 IDNO KOMZ 30/3
2 UK National Health Service Number

those should have date ranges - NHS numbers were originally Identity Card
numbers (so issued c 1939), then were retained for NHS use, then all got
changed.

Whilst we're here, we can note down how we are supposed to support
some features.



Adoption

2 PEDI Adopted
1 ADOP
2 FAMC @F2@
2 DATE ...

this will break both Family and X!Family which do not expect
to see a FAMC twice at the top level. Elsewhere in the spec.
it looks as though the first (top-level) FAMC for the adoptive
partnership is optional. The trouble with that is that we use
the top-level one to show the tree graphically.

There is an additional bit of structure to show which partner
adopted (HUSB/WIFE/BOTH) but again, this fails to cope with
a same-sex civil partnership ...

Military, police or other service rank

TITL is supposed for be for "Nobility title", not rank.
rank is supposed to go after the NAME as a +1

both ranks and titles have effective dates, and higher rank, additional titles
etc. should be documented.
