Dbox adjustments

With extra buttons and ID fields, we are getting to a point where we will need
to make some adjustments to the layout of the INDI and FAM dboxes to accomodate
buttons with longer words, and try to make the dboxes consistent with each other.

At present the various name fields (Husband, Wife, Name, Father, Mother) are all
the same width and to their right is a field to hold the ID of that person, if
they are filled in. Otherwise we variously have "Add" and "Find" buttons. We
are now considering having, for the spouses in a FAM dbox, a "Remove" button
which would have to share space with the ID field. But it would need to be a
little larger than a "Find" button to show the word "Remove". We'd also be
shrinking the ID field to allow space for "Remove" and I don't want to have to
keep changing the width of that, just hide() and show() are all we want to be
doing.

Whilst we are on consistency, you'll notice that both the "Date" and "Time" fields
for FAM events are wider than for INDI events. This is because for just the Death
event in an INDI, we also have an "Age" field for which we want to allow space,
whilst keeping the "Date" and "Time" fields the same size between tabs.

We are already in the postion that just a very few of the family have names too
long for the space in the edit dbxes, but we note that none of the Husband,
Wife, Father or Mother fields are editable, just the "Name" in the indiUI.
So I'm going to propose making that wider, and moving the ID field down to the
row with "Title" where we can indeed have enough space to label it "ID"

Current widths:

fullw (place, site, plot, cause) 390
smallw
redw (name, husband, wife,
      father, mother)            280 already reduced from 310
smallw (title)                   255 bigger than really needed
idw                              105 already increased from 75
addw                              50
findw                             50 not big enough for a "Remove" button
datew (INDI)                     130
timew (INDI)                      90
agew                              50

OK as at v0.21 2022-02-19, I've made the name field on an indiUI full width
of the dbox, and move the ID to the following line, shortening title somewhat.

Ah, I've broken it - editing an INDI with no parents is no longer showing the
Add/Find dboxes. Bollocks ... that will be a side effect of removing the
unsaved_tag code, I expect... No, it is an effect of loading a broken GEDCOM
to test the integrity check alerts. Doh !

New widths:

fullw (name, place, site, plot, cause) 390
smallw
redw (husband, wife)                   260 already reduced from 310
redw (father, mother)                  280 already reduced from 310
smallw (title)                         255 bigger than really needed
idw                                     55 decreased from original 75 - may be too small for longer IDs (OK up to I9999?)
addw                                    55 increased to line up with the ID
findw                                   60 not big enough for a "Remove" button
remw                                    70
remcol                                 400 col1+redw+5+addw+5
datew (INDI)                           130
timew (INDI)                            90
agew                                    50
