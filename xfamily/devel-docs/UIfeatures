main UI

  Fl_Window* w = window = new Fl_Window(600, 400);
  w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
  w->resizable(scroll);
  w->size_range(400,100,maxX,maxY);

don't really understand how things inside the main window get associated
with the window, though we can see how they are set up...

  Fl_Menu_Bar* o = main_menu = new Fl_Menu_Bar( 0, 0, 600, 25);
  Fl_Scroll* o = scroll = new Fl_Scroll(0,25,600,375);
  o->type(Fl_Scroll::BOTH_ALWAYS);
    { treedisplay* o = main = new treedisplay(0,25,maxX-17,maxY-42);
      o->setview( this );
    ...

main window has close, all-desktops, minimise, maximise, scrollbars and is resizable

-------------

indi UI

  { Fl_Window* o = indi_dbox = new Fl_Window( dboxwidth, dboxheight, buf_indi_title );

indi dbox has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable

-------------

fam UI

  { Fl_Window* o = fam_dbox = new Fl_Window( dboxwidth, dboxheight, buf_fam_title ); // *not* msg_fam_title :-)

fam dbox has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable

-------------

stats UI

  { Fl_Window* o = statsdbox = new Fl_Window(520, 165, msg_stats_title);

stats dbox has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable and currently isn't big enough !!
 Minimise seems a little pointless, as it doesn't update until you close and reopen it. So it
 probably should be modal.

-------------

find UI

  { Fl_Window* o = findbox = new Fl_Window(500, 65, msg_find_title);
    o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);
    o->hotspot( find_ok, 0);

find dbox has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable and currently isn't big enough !!

It probably ought to be modal and not have minimise

-------------

completions UI

  { Fl_Window* o = completionswin = new Fl_Window( 400, 500, msg_completions_title );
    o->labeltype(FL_NO_LABEL);

completions window has close, all-desktops, minimise, maximise, vertical scrollbar and is resizable,
but really ought to be a fixed width (we've calculated column widths to fit the data we are going
to display, so resizing the window horizontally makes very little sense).

Having a minimise button is a bit off, as you can minimise it and forget it's there, which
has side effects if you want to open a new one (the old one gets closed, but the new one
kinda remembers where it was...)

-------------

info UI

  Fl_Window* w = info_panel = new Fl_Window( 520, 210, msg_info_title );
  w->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);
  w->set_non_modal();

info window has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable and currently isn't big enough
 if you click on the © button. Also, when you do that, the OK button obscures some of
 the text. Altogether rather shambolic :-(

info UI shouldn't have a minimise button, and should probably be modal.
OK, removing w->set_non_modal(); didn't help and adding
w->set_modal(); left infoUI with a minimise icon still, which when clicked,
resulted in the window disappearing, with nothing on the task bar, but the
remaining mainUI windows totally unresponsive

-------------

pref UI

  { Fl_Window* o = optsbox = new Fl_Window(460, 315, msg_prefs_title);
    o->color(50);
    o->labeltype(FL_NORMAL_LABEL);

prefs dbox has close, all-desktops, minimise, isn't resizeable

-------------

notes UI

  window = new Fl_Window(720, 305, notes_title);
  window->resizable(input);

notes window has close, all-desktops, minimise, maximise and is resizeable, but needs,
 and doesn't have, scrollbars. It has what looks like a menu bar (and indeed, looking
 at the code, that's what it is), but which really acts like a load of buttons.
 As such, the buttons should be made to look like buttons, and should be at the
 bottom of the window, not the top.

OK, so the text is displayed in an   input = new Fl_Multiline_Input(0, 55, 720, 250);
can we put that inside an Fl_Scroll ?

Alternative approach is to use an Fl_Text_Display - this seems to have worked,
using fix0007, except that a Text_Display expects us to have callbacks for all
the editing things, so perhaps we now need to change it to an Fl_Text_Editor
widget instead... - remarkable, we changed just four lines and that worked :-)

-------------

A number of the windows uses the current tree filename in the title, but
are not really big enough - indiUI, famUI, ...

notes UI has the filename in the window title, but not the name of the FAM or
INDI (or event) on which it is raised, which makes it hard to identify in
the task bar if you have a load open (and maybe minimised)

findUI and completions UI have no indication in the window title of the
filename.

main UI title includes filename and current INDI name, but perhaps
in the wrong order, but that's debatable. Which bit of info is more
important if you have a small bit of tree displayed so there isn't
room for both ?
