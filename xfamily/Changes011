Changes in v 0.11

2000.09.13 added various casts to stop errors from pedantic new ANSI C++
           unchanged v 0.10 code would not compile on Mandrake 7.1 system
           also needed an extra -I in CXXFLAGS to find <string>
2000.09.13 tree.cxx: fixed bug in treeinstance::add_id where old compiler
           had invented code to do the right thing when I had missed it
           out. New compiler requires me to actually return a value :-(
2000.09.13 gui.cxx, gui.h, callback.cxx, callback.h, MessageSrc and its
           derivatives: added "Help" buttons to indiUI, famUI and prefUI
           boxes. As yet the callback routines don't do anything...
2000.09.13 same files again: added extra items to main window Help menu
           which will (in due course) shell out to a help browser
2000.09.15 makeinclude: now statically linked with fltk 1.09 (not 1.06).
           Seems to have fixed the "window reopens shifted down" problem
           under KDE. Need to check its gone under Gnome too...
2000.09.15 gui.cxx, gui.h: added "Child" menu item to both popups, and
           "GEDCOM" item to help menu
2000.09.15 callback.cxx: first attempt to shell out to help browser makes
           assumption that we can use khelpcenter. Now working for this,
           and demonstrated with gnome-help-browser, but still don't how
           to find which desktop we are under to choose. (This means it doesn't
           currently work under KDE 1.1 as we have hard coded "khelpcenter")
2000.10.30 a family with a known mother but no name for father showed up
           _two_ bugs, one causing a core dump. That was a bug in
           thespouseof(), the other was in settop(), in that the wrong
           pointer was being used to look for a mother.
2000.11.12 new GEDCOM_object( GEDCOM_tag*, char* ) now splits the new
           object using the CONC tag if the string is longer than MAX_GEDCOM_text
           characters. This will occur even if the file being read in has longer lines
           than that (the GEDCOM Spec. allows up to 256 char lines).
2000.11.12 improved handling of concatenation of CONC lines when loading NOTE
           or TEXT objects into a notesUI window.
2000.11.12 added first editing functionality - can now save notes window back to
           GEDCOM: added GEDCOM_object::remove_subobject.
2000.11.13 added "Restore from GEDCOM" and "OK (save and close)" buttons to notesUI
           fixed missing menu item "unmarry" on fammenu (long standing bug just noticed)-:
           NB messages file changed from earlier v011.
