Changes in v 0.13

2001.02.19 !Family at 2.25 was fixed for TIME to be a subordinate tag to DATE so
           now there is a test file for this (correct) GEDCOM. Same fix here - all
           in gui.cxx (no write-back yet).
2001.02.19 Added explicit specification of calendar to event dates. Currently we
           support only Gregorian and Julian (and *not* an unspecified option).
           Probably should add buttons for "unknown" now, and "Roman", "French
           Revolutionary" and "Hebrew" soon.
           Note a minor GEDCOM bug here - if the calendar type is not explicitly
           specified with an escape, then GEDCOM says we should assume Gregorian.
           This leaves us with no way to specify that we don't know which calendar
           was being used.

These changes bring X!Family v0.13 into line with !Family for RISC OS v 2.25 alpha.

2001.02.19 gui now has a box for "sources" for all nine events (BIRT, CHR, BAPM,
           DEAT, CREM, BURI, ENGA, MARR, DIV) so UI corresponds with !Family 2.25
           but as yet no code to display the source references in the box :-(
