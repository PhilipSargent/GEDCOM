ToDo::

You probably need to reread and understand ../Display4
Then try to figure out what of that we have already done - presumably none

Missing dboxes:

  Marry

  Person chooser (from wildcard find)

Dboxes requiring a rework:

  People->Find  needs a "find a list" button or similar

  Possibly famUI - we might want to add tabs for
    Banns
    Marriage Licence
    Annulment           though these are uncommon

  notesUI needs a "Restore" button and an "OK (save & close)" button.
  the code to support these is already written.

---------------

We do not have the great screed of code needed to:

remove a single object and any tags which cross reference to it
 (code now written to remove a single subobject from an object. Note
  that the object still exists, it is merely no longer a subobject, so is
  "out of the structure". Cross references to it should still work.)
insert an object, which, for an INDI, means finding the right point
 alphabetically
massacre the tree

We possibly have a problem with:

managing a display with no people at all in it (try loading an
 empty GEDCOM and see how spectacularly X!Family crashes :-)
