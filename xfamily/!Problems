Problems v011 alpha

when we do a "save", the tree.filename gets updated, and subsequent
windows reflect the new filename in their titles. But existing ones
are not updated. Arguably, this is OK, since "save" should not
change the filename (but for testing purposes, it does).

However, it is useful to note that "save as" *should* remember to
reopen/retitle windows that reflect the filename in their title bar.

Currently, closing any of the views kills the program. Since we can
now have new views, it is probably a priority to be able to kill
them cleanly without an exit(0) :-)

We need to find how to force window updates without doing a hide and
reopen - there are two problems with this:

a) under Gnome, everything shifts down and right a bit
b) on a language change, all the windows on different virtual screens
 reopen on the current one.

Progressing up a deep tree eventually results in the window going
uniform grey with no-one displayed. This is quite recoverable by
using "Find Person". I suspect that the work area size is getting
too big for the size of int being used to hold it.

Despite coding to prevent a section of tree appearing twice when
cousins have married and their common ancestor is on the tree, this
still occurs. You should note that although the section of tree
*doesn't* appear twice in !Family, the tree is distorted in that
the space for a second appearance *is* allowed for.
