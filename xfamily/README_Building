New versions:

Copy the current version to a new directory named with a version number +1

You need to change the version number in a few places, most notably
in MessageSrc and in xlate.cxx where the messages files are loaded
from a fixed path which includes the version number.

Files like Changes, Upcoming, Bugs probably want new versions, too.
We really don't have a "proper" system for keeping track of bugs and
the code fixes intended to address them. Should really have a proper
bug tracker, and a proper version control system (we already pretty much
abandoned the internal fix000x conditional compilation stuff for new
features and bug fixes).

When you have edited MessageSrc, run ./StringFactory.py - the make
sequence doesn't do this automagically. We probably ought to make
messages/en a target and run StringFactory.py to make it - any
other language files will automatically be recreated too.
StringFactory.py is almost certainly python 2 which needs porting
to python 3...

You'd need to make messageSrc a dependency for strings.cxx and
strings.h as well as messages/en and messages/fr (or make it a
dependency for the individual message files). The existing way
of doing this internationalisation is kind of a one-off unique
to us and not readily amenable to adding new languages. We
should look at using one of the mainstream methods of doing
translations of messges. Or just accept that we have a minimal
user base who all speak English as a first language anyway.
