New versions:

Copy the current version to a new directory named with a version number +1

You need to change the version number in a few places, most obviously
in messages which include the version number. Should rally be defined in
one place as a #define and then used at will.

Files like Changes, Upcoming, Bugs probably want new versions, too.
We really don't have a "proper" system for keeping track of bugs and
the code fixes intended to address them. Should really have a proper
bug tracker, and a proper version control system (we already pretty much
abandoned the internal fix000x conditional compilation stuff for new
features and bug fixes).

We removed the build-process breaking internationalisation. We
should look at using one of the mainstream methods of doing
translations of messages. Or just accept that we have a minimal
user base who all speak English as a first language anyway.
