New versions:

You need to change the version number in a few places, most notably
in MessageSrc and in xlate.cxx where the messages files are loaded
from a fixed path which includes the version number.

Files like Changes, Upcoming, Bugs probably want new versions, too.

When you have edited MessageSrc, run ./StringFactory.py - the make
sequence doesn't do this automagially. We probably ought to make
messages/en a target and run StringFactory.py to make it - any
other language files will automatically be recreated too.

You'd need to make messageSrc a dependency for strings.cxx and
strings.h as well as messages.en
