<h1><a name="">X!Family Appendix C.</a> Obtaining, compiling and installing X!Family</h1>

<p>X!Family is available from the
<a href="http://www.pennine.demon.co.uk/family/downloads.htm#X">!Family
downloads page</a>. Along with the latest version of these
<a href="http://www.pennine.demon.co.uk/family/xfam-docs.zip">help pages</a>.

<p>The author (and occasional maintainer - development has been a bit slow
to absent over the last three years) can be contacted as user <b>family-maint</b>
on the site <b>pennine.demon.co.uk</b>.

<p><b>Compiling X!Family</b>: I haven't mastered the subtleties of ./configure,
so some manual tweaking may be needed. First untar the download into a suitable
directory:

<pre>
# cd /usr/local/src/xfamily
# tar xzvf xfamily-v014.tgz
# cd v014
</pre>

<p>Now edit the line in the file "makeinclude" which specifies where your
C++ headers live:

<pre>
cppinclude	=/usr/include/c++/3.2
</pre>

<p>And edit the line in the "Makefile" which says where you compiled
FLTK (ie. where the headers live, not the library):

<pre>
FLTKHOME = /usr/src/fltk-1.1.4
</pre>

<p>Now compile it and clean up:

<pre>
make clean
make depend
make
make tidy
</pre>

<p>At this point you should be able to run the code in place with

<pre>
# ./XFamily &
</pre>

<p>But if you have root privilege, you can

<pre>
# make install
</pre>

<p>Which should allow anyone to run it. 

<p><b>NOTE</b>: this is alpha release software, and running in a terminal
is recommended, as you can then see all the debugging info which will still
be emitted. At present the GEDCOM file name is hard coded into the program
as <b>/usr/local/src/xfamily/test/test2.ged</b>, but you can readily make
this a symbolic link to your real data, or copy your data to this location:

<pre>
ln -s /path/to/real/data/myfamily.ged /usr/local/src/xfamily/test/test2.ged

cp -v -p /path/to/real/data/myfamily.ged /usr/local/src/xfamily/test/test2.ged
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the location of the messages used for internationalisation are
compiled in as /usr/local/src/xfamily/v014/messages/<br>
In time, these messages should really be moved to the "installed" location
at /usr/local/share/xfamily/messages/<br>
Something very similar applies to the help pages, which at present don't work
at all.

<h2>Hacking the code</h2>

<p>If you want to make changes to the code, you may want to add translatable messages,
which are coded in the source file "MessageSrc". The format is pretty transparent, and
adding a new language is also fairly easy (and I'd welcome such translations). To get
from this source to the various c++ and header files, and the formatted messages files,
there is a Python script. In the source directory type

<pre>
./StringFactory.py
</pre>

<p>If your changes to the code involve letting X!Family deal with new tags, you'll need
to add these to the list in "KnownTags", and then run the script

<pre>
./TagFactory.py
</pre>

<p>Of course, in time, these will be dealt with in the Makefile, with suitable dependencies.
