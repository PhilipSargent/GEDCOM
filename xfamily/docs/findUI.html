<h1><a name="60">X!Family Chapter 6.</a> Searching for a person</h1>

<p>In the main window, the menu item People-&gt;Find opens a dbox labelled
"X!Family Search tree for person". Typing a name here and clicking OK will
make that person current. However, this only works if you type the name
<i>exactly</i> as it is recorded in the database. The three buttons
<img alt="" width=75 height=25 align=right hspace=5 vspace=5 src="comp.png">
at the right of the dbox are intended to overcome this difficulty. The same
set of three buttons also appear in other places where you need to enter a
name exactly as it exists in the database, such as for the names of parents
in the Edit Person dbox.

<p>If you type in part of a name, and click one of the buttons, X!Family
will search the database for matching names, and if any are found, will open
a dbox containing a list of the possible names. The three buttons each attempt to perform "name completion" in a different way:

<p><img alt="" align=left hspace=10 vspace=2 width=25 height=25 src="c-r.png">
Completion to right. If you type in the first few characters of a name
(a first christian name, for example), X!Family will try to complete the
name by adding to the right.

<p><img alt="" align=left hspace=10 vspace=2 width=25 height=25 src="c-l.png">
Completion to left. Here you type in a few characters from the end of
a name (eg. the surname) and X!Family tries to complete the name by adding
to the left.

<p><img alt="" align=left hspace=10 vspace=2 width=25 height=25 src="c-f.png">
Fuzzy completion. Here you type in almost anything, and X!Family will
try to find a match. Initially, this will be a very simplistic method -
probably just looking for names containing what you typed somewhere inside.
Some distance into the future, a more intelligent algorithm may be added,
perhaps configured in the preferences dbox to use something like the
Soundex method.

<p>At present (v 0.13), all three buttons access the same code, which is
completion to the right. V 0.14 should add the code to do the three types
of search now that the basic functionality has been tested ...

<p>The result of the search is presented in a window containing a list of
names found, in the order in which they appear in the database. !Family
maintains names in alphabetical order within the GEDCOM file, and when
read/write ability is added to X!Family, it will do the same. But GEDCOMs
imported from elsewhere may not do so, and it is beyond the scope of either
program to sort the database.

<p>For the "Goto" (Search tree for person) dbox, clicking on a name in the
list should immediately make that person current. For other uses of name
completion, the name will be copied into the the relevant field of the dbox
from which it was called up.
