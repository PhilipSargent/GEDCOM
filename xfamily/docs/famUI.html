<h1><a name="">X!Family Chapter 4.</a> Family event dbox</h1>

<p>Right-clicking over a marriage in the main window pops up a menu:

<p><img alt="Marriage pop-up menu" width=200 height=170 align="center"
hspace=10 vspace=10 src="fmenu.png">

<p>Choose "Edit" to get a dialogue which displays date and place of
marriage.

<p><img alt="Family event dialogue: marriage" width=482 height=337
align="center" hspace=10 vspace=10 src="marrtab.png">

<p>You can see, enter, or change the date, time and place of the
marriage (but not the names of the people involved). Clicking on
the engagement tab gives a similar dialogue with a date and time
(the latter perhaps not very meaningful) for the engagement.

<p>For those marriages which ended in a divorce, the final tab lets you
edit the date and time of this. A place is not meaningful in most cases,
unless you consider that this is the court which issued the final decree.
However, that would usually be defined by the supporting documentation.

<p>Clicking "Cancel" closes the dialogue without saving any changes made.
Typically you would do this if you had opened the dialogue just to read
the details. Clicking "OK" saves the current details back into the database.
Clicking "Help" brings up this screenbook page in your current help system.
