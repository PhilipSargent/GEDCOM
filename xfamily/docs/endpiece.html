<h1><a name="">X!Family Screenbook endpiece</a></h1>

<p>That's all there is at the moment. Quite a lot of this manual remains
to be written for two reasons:

<ol>
<li>Manuals always lag behind the software, because no one can document
what a program does until after it has been written. In fact, this manual is
better than most because it describes some of the functionality which has
yet to be added to the code. Writing the manual has been and is an ongoing
part of the design process.
<li>Some quite large areas of intended functionality have not yet been
designed at all. Currently, those aspects of the code which emulate or
replace the functionality of the RISC OS !Family program have mostly been
designed, but parts of the interface which are intended to address various
perceived inadequacies of !Family are subject to periodic radical rethink,
and will require prolonged productive use of the software to see what needs
to be done.
</ol>

<p>It is hoped to continue the process of co-evolving the manual with the
software so that all the functionality in the product is documented, before
or very soon after it is implemented. Don't worry - unlike many programmers,
I enjoy writing documentation !
