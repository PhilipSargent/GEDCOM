<h1><a name="10">X!Family Chapter 1.</a> Introduction</h1>

<p>X!Family is an editor for Genealogy (Family Tree) Databases working
directly with the internationally standardised GEDCOM file format. It
has an intuitive visual interface using which details of families, people
and events can be browsed and edited directly on a graphical view of the
family tree. It was inspired by Dennis Howes' !Family, a BASIC program
for RISC OS computers which is great to use, but getting very slow on old
machines with a big database.

<p>X!Family is written in C++ using the FLTK toolkit. Using a compiled
language makes it much faster than an interpreted one, and the toolkit
chosen promises portability to the Wintel platform eventually. The
current version runs on Linux using either of the popular Desktops, KDE
and Gnome. X!Family is released under the GNU General Public License and
is statically linked with FLTK. FLTK is released under the GNU Library
Public License, and need not be obtained unless you intend to compile
X!Family yourself. See Appendix C for details on obtaining the latest
versions of X!Family and FLTK, compiling, porting and installing.

<p>X!Family uses the standard shared C libraries that should exist on
most systems. The compiled binaries depend on the versions that come with
the Mandrake 7.1 distribution, so if you use a different distro, it may
be simpler just to get the source and compile it against your installed
versions. Binaries targeted for different distributions will be made
available once the code is a lot more stable.

<h2>Alpha Release Software</h2>

<p>At present, X!Family is in early development, but is already useful. Much
of the user-interface is already visible, though some parts of it do nothing
as yet. It mainly deals with GEDCOM files "Read-only", though the first
read/write functionality has been added for NOTE objects. At alpha stage, the
program loads and saves in (different) fixed locations so there is no danger
of the program corrupting your valuable database. It is already a versatile
browser for existing databases, and through its cut-and-paste features, you
can export notes to your favourite text editor. It supports multiple views of
different parts of the same tree, and allows the event details and notes for
multiple people to be viewed simultaneously.
