<h2>!Family: creating a family tree</h2>

<p>If you have an existing GEDCOM file from elsewhere, you may want to
skip this page and get on with <a href="aedit.htm">editing a tree.</a>

<p>If !Family is started by double-clicking its icon, you will get an
empty main window titled "!Family &lt;untitled&gt;". Creating a tree is
simply a matter of adding a person to start from, and then adding relatives
to build up your tree. It is usually easiest in family research to work
backwards from the current generation, and this is also a very
straightforward way of adding people to your GEDCOM file in !Family.

<p>Click MENU in the window, and a menu pops up. The first item in the
menu is "Person &gt;":- opening the submenu from this reveals a long list
of options, all of which are greyed out except the first one, "Edit".
Choose this to open a dialogue box into which you can type details of
the person to be added to the tree. When the details are correct, click
"OK" (or hit return in any of the input fields) to close the dbox and create
the person.

<p>If you place the caret in one of the fields which expect a date (Born,
Died, Christened, Baptised, Cremated or Buried), you can edit details of the
time and location of this event by clicking on the "Details..." button. Note
that this can only be done once a person has been created and appears on the
the tree, so for a new person, you must click on "Update" which puts the
changes so far into the tree, and ungreys the "Details..." button. 

<p>Speaking of dates, these must be in a specific format, in order for
the resulting GEDCOM file to be portable to other people and other software.
By default this format must be the format defined in the GEDCOM standard
itself, but by changing an option in the !Family.Choices files, you can
arrange to load code at start-up which supports other date formats. So
far the only alternative is the international standard ISO-8601 format
(which everyone is encouraged to use anyway !) which is far more logical
than any other numeric-only format, and eliminates possible transatlantic
confusion.

<p>Once you have at least one person in your tree, there are several ways
to add more.

<ul>
<li>You can create new, unconnected people by doing exactly the same as
above. There is no particular restriction on how many unconnected trees
you can have in a GEDCOM file
<li>By filling in names in the "Father" and "Mother" fields of a person
in the Edit dbox, you can create parents, or connect new people to existing
parents
<li>By clicking menu on a person and choosing "Marry" you get a dbox in
which you can fill in the name of a spouse. If this is a name in the tree,
the two people become married. If it is a new name, a new person is created.
<li>By clicking menu on a person and choosing "Child" from the menu, you
get an Edit dbox for the new child, with some details filled in.
</ul>

<h3>CAUTION!</h3>

<p>For historical reasons to do with the way !Family does internal searches
for existing persons, <b>every person in the database must have a unique
name</b>. It is intended to remove this restriction in a future release,
but this involves substantial changes to the program. There is
<a href="unique.htm">a fuller discussion on unique names</a> for those who
feel the need to know.

<p>If you have several people in your tree with the same name (for example, I
have four successive generations of "Henry Walmesley /Welch/") you need to
add some extra bit of text to distinguish them. I find the easiest way to
do this is to add a birth year in brackets after the name (such as "Henry
Walmesley /Welch/ (1839)").
