********************************************************************************

Bring into conformity with GEDCOM 5.5 by removing the CEME, SITE and PLOT
tags, and implementing a structured PLAC with essentially the same user
interface as at present. The issue is what to use as our internal delimiter.
GEDCOM expects that the structure will be delimited by commas, but, of course,
these are already used internally within the strings, which would make it hard
for us to parse off at what level things should go. That is, of course, fairly
arbitrary anyway, but we would like to preserve what the user chose if at all
possible. Within a cemetery we can delimit the old PLOT tag simply with the word
plot.

Actually, we have a fairly clear idea of the level of division between PLAC
(essentially a map-defined place with some sort of administrative boundary,
and, ideally, the smallest such unit, such as a parish or a village name
within a parish) SITE/CEME essentially an address of a building or property
PLOT a location within a property (ie. a precise burial location in a
graveyard or cemetery).

Move to implement the NAME subtags NPFX, GIVN, NICK, SPFX, SURN and NSFX

Although we currently include UK National Grid References for a lot of our
places, this is in no way formalised. In GEDCOM 5.5, PLAC has a MAP subobject
with LATI and LONG subtags which expect degrees and decimal fractions (ie.
not minutes and seconds). There is no provision for alternate coordinate systems
such as UTM or UK National Grid. We could choose to implement this information
with specifically formatted NOTE structures.

We should really support the format for dates derived by interpretation from a
free-form date as in  DATE (int) <date> (The Thursday before Palm Sunday, 1788)

Remove the LVG tag, introduce the RESN tag. I believe we should only support
the "confidential" value within our GEDCOM. Exported GEDCOM which removes
information from objects marked as confidential, should use 'RESN privacy'
to indicate that data are missing from this transmission. We could use the
'RESN locked' field for stuff that we know looks wrong but is proven by
enough evidence that we should be preventing casual alteration of the record.
However, this object was really intended for publically-accessible records,
and may not seem appropriate for a personal desktop product. The GEDCOM
documentation doesn't seem to be clear about whether a record which is
both locked and confidential uses both keywords in one tag, or repeats

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To contemplate the next section, we need to have edit functionality on
events (there's no sense in having a UI to add extra events if we have
no way of keeping the events - we'd be generating pointers to bombsville...)

So to what extent do we have ANY editing functionality now ?

We believe we have full editing of NOTE objects, so we need to test this
to be sure (and to do that, we need to be sure that our "save" function
is actually working - there's a suspicion that it did, and now might not.
OK it works except where it can't open the file for writing, in which
case it fails safely, with a message to the terminal which may not be
seen. We don't display a "modified" indicator anywhere.). We have been
working on some code to support indiUI editing in v 0.17.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major change contemplated for this version is to remove the fixed tabs
on the INDI and FAM objects (BIRT,CHR,BAPM,DEAT,CREM,BURI; ENGA,MARR,DIV)
and allow arbitrary appropriate events to be added to these objects, each
creating a tab for entry or editing of the details. So the INDI ui would
initially be rather bleak and empty-looking for a newly created INDI object,
but clicking on an 'Add Event' button would give a menu of possible events,
and choosing one would add the appropriate subobject to the INDI object,
and a suitable tab to the dbox. In theory, this could allow you to have, for
example, two BIRT tags, for different dates with different sources, although
we would definitely need an 'are you sure' dialogue to allow that. We'd
also want to clearly define which one would be displayed in the tree view -
and probably display that with a question mark or in a colour that indicates
that it is an alternative, not definitive...

The object here is to simplify the user interface for the majority of
individuals and families that do not have all the various events defined
(you don't need BURI or CREM for someone lost at sea; you are unlikely to
need both CHR and BAPM for most people; you don't need DIV for most
marriages, and there aren't many for which you will know the details to
fill in the ENGA tag). But also to provide the flexibilty to record other
events for those few individuals and families that need them. For instance,
multiple birth dates from different sources; perhaps two MARR objects, one
for a TYPE Common Law, and one for a legal marriage at a later date; and
records for Banns, marriage by licence, marriage contracts or settlements,
and so on.

Internally, we need a list of events for which we can create tabs, a
preferred order in which tabs would appear (usually the order in which
the associated events would _normally_ appear chronologically) and, of
course, a detailed layout for each of these tabs.

Implementation detail: How do we add a new tab to a dbox ? Does FLTK
display them in the order that they were defined, or can we insert a new
tab into a list between existing tabs ? The former will be much more of a
pain as we would need to basically rebuild the dbox from scratch anytime
a new event with associated tab was added (or an old one removed).
