Some changes were needed to get XFamily to compile on kent, using gcc 4.3 and fltk 1.1.9

main.cxx: int main(int argc, char* **argv) {      is faulted
          int main(int argc, char** argv) {       is allowed
 but whether it actually is what we should be doing is unclear

However, we do seem to be able to pass in a filename argument, so it is probably OK

gui.cxx:     both now need #include <stdlib.h> to make atoi()
trees.cxx:    work.

to compile on kent under precise, we use fltk 1.3 which has important API
changes. Set fltk13 in fixes.h to compile the new code.

-------------

xlate.cxx: update version number in the path to load messages. Should not
 need to do this - its a bug.

-------------

2011-09-08 finally got fed up enough to add about two lines of code to main.cxx so we
 can specify the file to load on the command line. (Which is good, as this is now
 the only way to code will run without a segfault...)
