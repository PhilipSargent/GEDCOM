## Installation

Clone this repository using either HTTPS or SSH:

**HTTPS (recommended for most users):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhilipSargent/GEDCOM.git
```

**SSH (if you have SSH keys configured):**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PhilipSargent/GEDCOM.git
```

**Note:** If you encounter a "Permission denied (publickey)" error when using SSH, either:
- Use the HTTPS URL instead (shown above), which doesn't require SSH keys
- Configure your SSH keys following [GitHub's SSH key setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
