This is a sub project to create a proper parsable grammar for GEDCOM 5.5.5 from the specificaiton PDF. 
This grammar will then be used to create lexers and parsers. It could also be used to create code tests for 
a parser which gives error message including the page number of the specification PDF.

This is an exercise in AI-assisted coding.
