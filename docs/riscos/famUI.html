<h1><a name="famUI">!Family Chapter 4.</a> Family event dbox</h1>

<p>Clicking menu over a marriage and choosing Edit from the pop-up menu
will get a dbox for events associated with the family concerned.
[!Family will work this way shortly, but doesn't yet, the screen shot shows
the current UI, click menu on a person and choose a spouse from the marriage
submenu:]:</p>

<p><img alt="Marriage pop-up menu" width=540 height=250 align=center
hspace=10 vspace=10 src="pmenu.png"></p>

<!-- <p>Choose "Edit" to get a dialogue which displays date and place of
marriage.</p> -->

<p><img alt="Family event dialogue: marriage" width=577 height=336
align=center hspace=10 vspace=10 src="marrtab.png"></p>

<p>Note that you can only get to this dbox for families where both partners
are already in the database - for a family with only one known parent, it
is not possible to add the marriage, engagement or divorce events. It is
quite possible that in a real family history you know the date or place
of a marriage, without knowing the name of one partner. In this case, you
will need to create a person with a dummy name to stand in the database
in order to create the marriage. Conversely, it is quite possible that
you have a couple who are parents, but were never engaged, married or
divorced - in this case you can get to the family events dbox, but
there is nothing to fill in. A future UI enhancement is on the road
map to allow for things like common-law marriage and illegitimacy.
GEDCOM also handles adoption, but in a rather complex way which I don't
think I can support in the very near future, but it is definitely on
the road map for future work.</p>

<p>You can see, enter, or change the date, time and place of the
marriage (but not the names of the people involved). Clicking on
the engagement tab gives a similar dialogue with a date and time
(the latter perhaps not very meaningful) for the engagement.</p>

<p>For those marriages which ended in a divorce, the final tab lets you
edit the date and time of this. A place is not meaningful in most cases,
unless you consider that this is the court which issued the final decree.
However, that would usually be defined by the supporting documentation.</p>

<p>In the same way that it is intended to make the Edit Person dbox
expansible by adding arbitrary events, the road map shows this dbox
changing to reflect only those events which actually occurred for a
particular family, but to allow for those events including things like
annulment, common-law marriage, marriage by license, and reading of
banns, all of which are supported by the GEDCOM standard.</p>

<p>Clicking "Cancel" closes the dialogue without saving any changes made.
Typically you would do this if you had opened the dialogue just to read
the details. Clicking "OK" saves the current details back into the database.
Clicking "Help" brings up this screenbook page in your current browser.</p>
