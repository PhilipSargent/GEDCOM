<p>!Family at version 2.2.7 implements GEDCOM version 5.3, which is not the current
standard. Whilst !Family will always preserve GEDCOM it cannot interpret, any new
GEDCOM that it generates will conform to the 5.3 specification. Unfortunately, a
number of the changes that were introduced by the GEDCOM developers at 5.3 have
been removed again, and will not be understood by some systems that expect GEDCOM
5.5. Work in the 2.3.x branch will aim to address this issue once the major UI
changes have been made, but in the meantime, you should note the following:</p>

<h2>Location over-structured in 5.3</h2>

<p>The tag for specifying a location, PLAC had, in 5.3, a subsidiary tag
SITE (or, in the specific case of a BURI event, a CEME tag with a further
PLOT subobject). !Family implements these tags as providing a useful degree
of structure, but in later versions of the GEDCOM specification, it was decided
that these tags were unnecessary, and that structure within the PLAC object
should be provided by simply adding delimiters to separate levels such as
country, state, county, city .... If you export 5.3 GEDCOM from !Family to
some other systems that expect strict 5.5 GEDCOM, you may lose the SITE,
CEME and PLOT data. Furthermore, GEDCOM 5.5 provides a way to tell other
systems what the exact structure of your location data is, in terms of
what lies between each delimiter. This would be fine if every location
had the same structure - the examples given in the GEDCOM Spec. are
noticeably USA-o-centric, suggesting Country, state, county, city, zip.
Unfortunately, anyone who has ancestors in more than one country will find
that the same definition will not cover the structure of a location in
different places. So that what we consider to be the PLAC may have two
or more components before a smaller division is what we would consider
the SITE. And obviously, most locations won't have something identifiable
as a PLOT, since that is only relevant to a cemetery.</p>

<p>It is intended to provide a method whereby !Family will display essentially
the same structure as at present, but store everything in the one PLAC object
with its own delimiter between the different levels. It will continue to
understand the 5.3 location tags, but will always export GEDCOM in strict 5.5
comformance. What we consider belongs in the PLAC is essentially an area down
to township/parish sort of level, whilst SITE takes you down to a specific
building, street address, or piece of land. PLOT is a location within a
piece of land used as a burial ground. Neither versions 5.3 or 5.5 really
support a geo-reference such as an Ordnance Survey grid reference or
UTM coordinate.</p>

<h2>Living tag</h2>

<p>A number of genealogy packages have an option to flag a person as being
living (at a particular datae) with the LVG tag, but this has never been
part of the official GEDCOM spec. !Family chose to implement this tag when
your author believed that it was a part of a GEDCOM version he had not managed
to get hold of documentation for, but this proved to have been an error.</p>

<p>There are two reasons for using this tag, one to provide evidence to
prevent a later editor from accepting a date of death before the one
recorded in the LVG object, and the other to withhold publication of data
concerning a living person. The former need is still not really addressed
by any official GEDCOM tag, but the latter is addressed by the RESN
(restriction notice) tag. This latter tag is somewhat ill-defined in that
one of its uses is to note that data have been withheld in a GEDCOM
generated for transmission to another system, whilst another seems to
be to indicate that data which are present in the current GEDCOM file
are to be treated as confidential. A third use is to indicate that a
particular group of data are to be 'locked' against change because of
false evidence 'in the wild' that continually causes people to try to
change a record which is already established by other, less widely
known evidence. These three different uses for the same tag seem a bit
ill-conceived and poorly thought out, but it is the intention that
!Family will bow to the GEDCOM committee and replace the LVG tag with
a restriction notice on output. This would be used (optionally) as the
LVG tag is at present, to remove sensitive data about living persons
from being put into the html pages which can be generated. By another
option, these data could be withheld from a GEDCOM output file. The
risk is that the data become lost from your main database, so the
intention is that the "save" dialogue will save your full GEDCOM
at all times, but that there will be a separate "export" dialogue
in which a series of options will enable the user to restrict
what data are retained in a GEDCOM file intended for transmission
to a third party. I've since found some packages use a different
way (using the EVEN tag) to include evidence that a person was
alive on a particular date, which seems to fit better with the
GEDCOM data model, so I'll try to add this to the existing codebase.</p>

<h2>Title tag</h2>

<p>GEDCOM has had a TITL tag for a long time, but in the GEDCOM 5.5
Spec. it has been clarified as being intended purely for titles of
nobility and not for such terms as "Doctor" or for military ranks.
These latter are meant to go into "prefix name part" subobjects of
the NAME object, which !Family does not currently implement (but it
is on the road map). Care is needed if you (like me) have used TITL
for these ranks and professional titles, as this will need a GEDCOM
conversion process at some stage in the future. It should also be
noted that all these titles (whether of nobility or profession)
should support a DATE object, either for the date of granting the
title, or a date range during which it was applicable. Given that
titles and ranks change over time, GEDCOM allows for multiple
TITL and PRFX objects, which !Family will preserve in imported
GEDCOM, but could corrupt if you try to edit the title.</p>
