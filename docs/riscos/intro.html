<h1><a name="intro">!Family Chapter 1.</a> Introduction</h1>

<p>!Family is an editor for Genealogy (Family Tree) Databases working
directly with the internationally standardised GEDCOM file format. It
has an intuitive visual interface using which details of families, people
and events can be browsed and edited directly on a graphical view of the
family tree. It has evolved from Dennis Howes' !Family, version 2.18.</p>

<h2>Stable and Development Software</h2>

<p>The last stable release prior to 2.2.7 was several years ago, at 2.24.
The 2.25 version was released as Alpha code, but has proven stable in use
for a long period, whilst 2.26 was a development version. The current 2.2.7
release is based on 2.25, with the removal of redundant code and a few
minor fixes. It is believed to be at least as stable as 2.25, but during the
release process, it was noticed that the interactive help subsystem (that
interacts with Acorn's !Help program) was broken. As no-one had reported this
in the whole time that 2.25 has been available, it was deduced that no-one
uses this subsystem, and it has been removed in it's entirety for 2.27.</p>

<p>!Family has been a fairly mature product for several years, but is now
undergoing a burst of development inspired by many user interface innovations
pioneered in the Linux program XFamily, which, in turn, was based on !Family.
It is now intended to maintain separate stable and development branches,
staarting from 2.2.7 as the first of a series of stable releases intended
to be suitable for production systems. The 2.3.x series will be the
development branch and will vary from completely broken (which is the
case as I write this, prior to a runnable 2.3.0) through alpha to beta
code.</p>

<p>The screenshot below is one of those from 2.24, and I've left it in
(click on it for a full resolution version) mainly because it indicates
how much the user interface has changed from 2.24 to 2.25 and later
versions...</p
