<h2>Pennine Software X!Family Genealogy Package</h2>

<p>X!Family is a complete rewrite in C++ of the popular !Family Genealogy
package on the Acorn RISC OS Platform. It is currently at early Alpha
stage, with much of the user interface visible, but none of the functionality
to actually edit GEDCOM files yet added. A few more features remain to be
added to this "readonly" version, before I add editing functionality. I find
it useful as a browser, especially given the ability to have different views
on the same tree and to look at multiple sets of notes at once. My typical
usage at present is to run X!Family on a 21" monitor on my Linux box, while
running !Family in an emulated RISC PC (which runs a lot more slowly) to
actually make changes.

<h3>Significant advances from !Family 2.2x:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Platform portable: being developed on Linux using a toolkit which also
runs on other platforms, including Windows.
<li>Compiled code is much faster - loads a 2000-person tree in seconds rather
than minutes, and updates to a new current person many times faster than the
old package.
<li>Supports multiple views on the same tree, each with a different "current"
person.
<li>Can have many edit windows open at once on different people, not just the
"current" person.
<li>Can open notes windows on any person, not just the "current" person, and
can have as many as you like open at once.
<li>Can open notes windows for families as well as individuals
<li>Can cut and paste between different notes windows
<li>Can change the language of all the messages dynamically while running -
well, it could three years ago. With recent versions of the base libraries,
this functionality seems to crash the program...
<li>Can change (as a compilation option at present) the font size used on
screen to support maximum usability - I use a small font to get a useful
amount of tree on an 800x600 laptop and usually a bigger font for comfortable
viewing on a 21" monitor, although the small font is also useful when viewing
a particularly complex tree even at 1920x1440.

</ul>

<p>Further new features are planned:

<ul>
<li>Will deal with sources and repositories
<li>Will allow more versatile wildcard searches in "Goto"
<li>Will allow multiple people with the same name in the tree
<li>Will support multiple documents (more than one GEDCOM in memory) and will
allow merging trees
</ul>

<p>Some of these features won't be implemented until a full editing
capability has been incorporated, but as much as possible will be added and
tested <b>before</b> adding the capability to corrupt your GEDCOM.

<p>Of course, the new package (currently under the "working" name of
X!Family) will be open source, and distributed under the GNU General Public
License. The current Alpha release is available as source (which is
invariably likely to be more up-to-date) or as an i386 binary (updated rather
less frequently) for Linux on the <a href="downloads.htm">downloads page</a>.
There is a user-manual after the style of the KDE desktop ones, which is
also being mirrored on the site as <a href="xdoc/index.htm">"The X!Family
Screenbook".</a> A <a href="xfamdocs-014.zip">zip</a> of all the screenbook
pages is also available for browsing offline.
