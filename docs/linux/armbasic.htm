<h2>!Family for RISC OS</h2>

<p>!Family is a BASIC program to maintain a family tree database on an Acorn
RISC OS platform (has been in frequent use on RO 3.1 and 3.5 - current
versions are being developed on RISC OS 4 but will be tested on 3.1). It uses
the worldwide standard GEDCOM file format to store its information, and can
therefore exchange data with most genealogical packages in use today. The
user interface is graphical through an on-screen family-tree in which members
of a family can be seen in the context of their relationships. This makes it
far easier to navigate than many genealogical packages whose interface is
purely textual, or which show only a tiny part of a tree structure at one
time.

<p>The tree display can be sent to a printer, or a !Draw file, and a variety
of reports can be generated. A complete website can also be created with a
page for each person in the tree, showing two generations of ancestors,
their marriage(s) and children and all relevant dates and notes.

<p>!Family was developed over several years (up to version 2.18) by Denis
Howe at Imperial College. Pennine Software added features for local
needs and intended sending these to Denis for incorporation into the
released version. Following Denis's desire to pass support of the program
on to someone else, these updates are now being made available by Pennine
Software and can be retrieved from the <a href="downloads.htm">downloads
page</a>. There have been a number of user-interface changes, one or two of
which seem to be causing some confusion, especially among users of earlier
versions - a radical rethink of some aspects of the interface is currently
in development which it is hoped will address all such confusion.
Documentation is currently ahead of development (!), but if you use
Acorn's interactive help program (!Help), the information it reports is
almost up to the minute in 2.24 and way out of date in 2.25.

<p>The current <b>stable</b> version is 2.24, while the development version
is 2.25. Significant additions and changes to the user-interface are detailed
inside the application in <b>!Family.Changes</b>. Noticeable bugs which have
been fixed are similarly detailed in <b>!Family.BugsFixed</b> whilst known
outstanding bugs (and a lot of wish-list items) are listed in
<b>!Family.Bugs</b>. I have removed the original !Help file, since this is
now quite confusing if used with the changes to user interface. New
<a href="fdoc/index.html">documentation in html format</a> is in preparation,
but relates to the new user interface style of the 2.25 development version.

<p>!Family by no means deals with all possible events and tags defined in
the GEDCOM standard, and lacks handling of that most important aspect of
genealogy, documenting your sources ! Work is in progress to add handling
for many extra tags without overwhelming the user interface in complex
detail which is rarely, if ever, used. GEDCOM structures dealing with sources
and their locations can become quite complex, and a major goal is to add
support for these in an easily-understood form.

<p>!Family produces GEDCOM which most closely corresponds with version
5.3. The more recent GEDCOM 5.5 specification removes some useful structure
which was present in 5.3 and which had recently been added into !Family.
In particular, for events birth, christening, baptism, death, cremation and
marriage, GEDCOM 5.3 split the location into "Place" and "Site" fields,
whilst burials were split into "Place", "Cemetery" and "Plot". GEDCOM 5.5
no longer supports this level of structure and work is in hand to provide
a method for !Family to save its tree in accordance with this new version,
whilst still preserving structured information.

<p>Currently !Family 2.24 is out of step with the GEDCOM spec. (both 5.3 and
5.5) in storing the TIME of an event at the same structural level as the
DATE. The time should, in fact, be one level below the date, and this is how
the development version 2.25 works. 2.25 comes with a small BASIC program to
convert GEDCOMs produced by versions 2.20 to 2.24 to the correct format
without losing all the times from existing files.

<p>A compiled program is being developed for Linux on both Acorn and other
platforms, and user-interface innovations from that code are providing
useful inspiration for further changes to !Family. You can get an idea
of how this work is progressing from the <a href="cplusplus.htm">X!Family
page</a>.

<p><b>Warning:</b> one new version of the code has been added to v
2.24 since the original posting (in April 2000). This fixes a minor bug in
provision of interactive help on the "Cremations" window.
