but, of course, that will make finding a particular person more complicated.
If you have several people in your tree with the same name (for example, I
have four successive generations of "Henry Walmesley /Welch/") you need to
add some extra bit of text to distinguish them. I find the easiest way to
do this is to add a birth year in brackets after the name (such as "Henry
Walmesley /Welch/ (1839)").

<p>There are ways to create people with identical names (for example,
creating them with different names, then editing them to be the same later),
but this results in trouble when one such person is to marry or be linked
into another part of the tree in some other way. You soon get used to
creating people with unique names, but it is a potential source of untold
grief if you import a GEDCOM file from some other package which allows lots
of different people with the same name.
