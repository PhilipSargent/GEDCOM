<h1><a name="">X!Family Chapter 1.</a> Introduction</h1>

<p>X!Family is an editor for Genealogy (Family Tree) Databases working
directly with the internationally standardised GEDCOM file format. It
has an intuitive visual interface using which details of families, people
and events can be browsed and edited directly on a graphical view of the
family tree. It was inspired by Dennis Howes' !Family, a BASIC program
for RISC OS computers which is great to use, but getting very slow on old
machines with a big database.

<p>X!Family is written in C++ using the FLTK toolkit. Using a compiled
language makes it much faster than an interpreted one, and the toolkit
chosen promises portability to the Wintel platform eventually. The
current version runs on Linux and has been tested using both of the popular
Desktops, KDE 3 and Gnome. X!Family is released under the GNU General Public
License. FLTK is released under the GNU Library Public License, and its source
and headers need not be obtained unless you intend to compile
X!Family yourself. See <a href="appc.html">Appendix C</a> for details on
obtaining the latest versions of X!Family and FLTK, compiling, porting and
installing.

<h2>Alpha Release Software</h2>

<p>At present, X!Family is in early development, but is already useful.
Much of the user-interface is already visible, though a lot of it does
nothing and as yet, it deals with GEDCOM files "Read-only", so there is
no danger of the program corrupting your valuable database. It is already
a versatile browser for existing databases, and through its cut-and-paste
features, you can export notes to your favourite text editor. It supports
multiple views of different parts of the same tree, and allows the event
details and notes for multiple people to be viewed simultaneously.
