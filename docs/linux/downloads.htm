<h3>!Family Package for Acorn RISC OS</h3>

<p>The latest stable release of this package is 2.2.7rc1, dated 2007-10-19 which
comes as a <a href="family227.zip">zipped application,</a> currently 517k. This is
a lot bigger than previous releases, despite a reduction in code size, owing mainly
to improved documentation. The previous <b>stable</b> version was 2.24, 2000-09-18
which is still available <a href="family224.zip">. There have been some major user
interface revisions since 2.24</a>, and a slight incompatibility in the GEDCOM (that
produced by versions 2.20 to 2.24 was slightly in error - 2.2.7 includes a small
utility program to fix this).</p>

<p>New features in 2.2.7 include:

<ul>
<li>Should not run low on memory - the heap is extended dynamically when
needed. This avoids the need to set a Wimpslot appropriate to your tree
size in the !Run file.
<li>New tabbed dboxes for life and family events, eliminating a lot of the
confusing aspects of the current interface.
<li>Can now specify Gregorian or Julian calendar on all dates.
<li>Early support for source citation via the SOUR tag on events.
<li>A number of bug fixes, including a memory leak and an apparent memory
leak if you believed the "free heap space" figure on the iconbar icon.
<li>Lots of minor fixes correcting non-serious bugs or minor usage issues.
<li>Some experimental Heap management libraries (not used by default).
</ul>

<h3>XFamily <b>Alpha</b> prerelease</h3>

<p>Version 0.13 has been out for a while. Version 0.14 has been in
development ever since I got feedback from a real user out there in
internet land. As I'm not going to be able to do any work on it for
a short while, I've tidied it up for a release. I'm no loner doing
binary releases, as it really is too much to compile the stuff for
several different versions of several different distributions. V 0.14
has been tested on Mandrake 9.0 and Mandrake 9.2 Linux, both using
version 1.1.4 of FLTK. I'd be pleased to hear of your success or
failure to build it on any other systems.

<p><b>WARNING:</b> you can put the binary anywhere you like (I just
run it where the build step leaves it, in /usr/local/src/xfamily/v014/XFamily
- there is no "make install" step as yet), but at the
moment, the GEDCOM file which the program reads is compiled in at<br>
/usr/local/src/xfamily/test/test2.ged for versions after v0.13<br>
which is not terribly helpful. Similarly, the messages files are looked for
at<br>
/usr/local/src/xfamily/v014/messages/&lt;name&gt;<br>
If you ask the program to write out its GEDCOM it will go to<br>
/var/test.ged<br>
Of course, you can use symbolic links to point these at any real file you
like. <b>Warning</b> the software is still at the
alpha stage (and may therefore crash unexpectedly) but now has some of the
functionality to change your GEDCOM file rather than being purely a browser.
You can save changed NOTEs back to the GEDCOM, so please take care if you
symlink the write location to the same place as the read location.

<p>Currently, emphasis is on writing the functionality to deal with GEDCOM
and display multiple views of a family tree. It may be some time (and
certainly not until a full editing capability has been added) until the
file-chooser functionality is written. I dislike the Linux file-loading
idioms (although the file-chooser in FLTK 1.1.4 is nicer), as compared
to the RISC OS "drag the file to the directory of choice" one, so I'd
hope to provide a choice of both idioms if possible.

<p>The <a href="xfamily-v014-src.zip">source distribution</a> is zipped
(currently 95k). It doesn't have anything like proper version numbers yet,
and comes with no guarantees, other than that it won't corrupt your GEDCOM
yet, as long as you don't put a symlink to make it overwrite its input. (This
guarantee will be removed in future versions :-). As of 0.14, the build
tools for the International messages have been rewritten in Python, instead
of needing you to have an Acorn RISC OS system on your desk. This was only
relevant to anyone who wanted to change code enough to need to add new
messages, or for translators to new languages. You will need the FLTK package,
which has its <a href="https://www.fltk.org/">own home page</a> and also comes
bundled with some distributions (eg. SuSE). There is a line in X!Family's
makefile which you may need to modify to tell it where to find FLTK if you
install it somewhere other than the default or have a different version than
the one I have (1.1.4). I think the code will no longer work with FLTK 1.0.x
versions, but 1.1.&lt;anything&gt; should be fine.

<p>You might also need to change paths to some C/C++ header files (at least
one lot seemed to move when I upgraded Mandrake versions). If anyone changes
things to use a ./configure script, I'd be really pleased to receive your
changes :-)

<p>If anyone compiles this under a system other than Linux, or with a
compiler other than gcc, I'd love to hear from you about any changes you had
to make to get it to work, or what problems you have that are stopping it
from compiling. I presonally have no interest in seeing a Windows version,
but if you want to build one and have to make changes, I'll incorporate
them into the distributed sources. If anyone would like to port FLTK to RISC
OS, I'd be overjoyed to hear from you too ! Unfortunately, I think the port
would need an X server, and the only one I know of for RISC OS is a ludicrously
expensive commercial offering (though I have heard that there are a couple of
free ones of unknown quality and availability).

<p>The user manual for xfamily lags slightly behind the actual code, and is
now on the site as an archive <a href="xfamdocs-014.zip">xfamdocs-014.zip</a>.
You can browse individual pages <a href="xdocs/index.html">on this site</a>,
but these pages may lag slightly further behind and it is recommended that
if you decide to download and build the software, you get the manual as a
zip and unpack it into /usr/local/src/xfamily/html014. From there you can
also browse it from the "Help" menu item within the program.
