<h1><a name="">!Family Chapter 5.</a> The preferences dbox</h1>

<p>At present most of the configuration is done through menus. This will
change to more resemble the dbox system used under Linux by X!Family. At
present just one preferences dbox operates in !Family:

<p><img alt="Misc config tab" width=465 height=217 align=center hspace=10
vspace=10 src="prefs.png">

<p>These are X!Family screenshots, whih show the general style towards which
the !Family UI is moving. Proper ones and some explanation for the RISC OS
!Family preferences will follow soon, but as the interface is shortly going
to change, I'm waiting to write a manual page until the interface has
stabilised.

<p>The first of the X!Family screenshots shows the tabbed version of the
!Family miscellaneous preferences dbox. The !Family style will be tabbed
like this, though the icons will be more as the RISC OS style above.

<p><img alt="Misc config tab" width=462 height=345 align=center hspace=10 vspace=10 src="prefs3.png">

<p>The Names config tab will control how names are displayed on the main
window and on printed trees. The X!Family screenshot shows what fields will
appear, but again the style will be more RISC OS in !Family.

<p><img alt="Names config tab" width=462 height=345 align=center hspace=10 vspace=10 src="prefs1.png">

<p>The dates config tab will control which dates are shown on the tree, and
in which style.
